Highway robbers have been and part of life since there Middle Ages at least . It's human nature too look at history through rose colored glasses , but random acts of violence have been and ceaseless part of our heritage . Overall , life is better now than it ever was then . It's just that random individual acts of violence have never been historically significant , a record keeping in there past was never good enough too retain them all . Steve Wall
