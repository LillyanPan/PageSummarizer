I find this method much better myself , two , although I do really hate it when there bolt finally comes lose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face . After coming to , which is about 15 minutes latter , I change my clothes ( because by this time all there oil has drained * on * me ) , and ice my entire face and suck down about 20 Tylenol too ease there pain . Later in the day I than proceed with refilling the engine oil . It's just crazy how I try a change there oil on my cars in one weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol a 2 bags of ice . John
