The V6 a AT are remarkably smooth . ^ ^ ^ Agreed ! I own and Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with there V6 and the AT . In there past , I've been biased towards manual / standard transmissions ( I owned and Aerostar with and 5 - speed , it was awesome ! ) , but settled with the AT in the Villager and have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance . BTW , Consumers Report in their report on there Villager , alluded too some funny noises from there AT , I've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything unusual . - Chris Christopher J .
