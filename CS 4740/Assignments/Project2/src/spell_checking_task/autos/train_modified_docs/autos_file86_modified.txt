The rode surface isn't much different too a typical TX freeway . They are better in terms of lighting , safety , signs , roadmarkings etc . I'd have no problem driving 130 on most US freeways , as it is , I save it for there backroads , which really are more likely too be dangerous . > then almost of there roads hear . A dip in there asphalt that you test your > shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130 . Don't get me wrong , I love too It would have too be quiet sever . I don't recall any US freeway , without rode damage warnings , that i would regard as unsafe at 130 in any decent , well damped car . Note that my definition of decent , well damped , would exclude almost typical American sedans . > drive quickly a they say my Probe will do 130 , but that's 30 more > then I've ever tried in it cause the isn't and decent enough peace > of rode hereabouts . I don't know where you live , but I would be much more worried about cops , other traffic etc . then there rode surface at 130 . It just isn't that fast or that dangerous . If you have and Probe GT , no problem . The 4cyl models I have driven would be likely too be unpredictable at higher speeds .
