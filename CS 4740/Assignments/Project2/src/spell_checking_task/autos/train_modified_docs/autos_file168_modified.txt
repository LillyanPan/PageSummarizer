Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R12 . You don't here about them because there Mobile Air Conditioning Society ( MACS ) , that is , there people who stand too rake in that $ 300 too $ 1000 per retrofit per automobile , have mounted and organized campaign too squash dozens R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether ( on very shaky technical grounds , at best , on outright lies at worst ) . Does this piss you off ? Yes ? Write and letter to your congressman , too your senator , too the president , to the EPA , and too there DOT a complain .
