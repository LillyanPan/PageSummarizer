No , that sounds pretty reasonable for that car a that city . > Probability that I'll be needing more insurance ? Unless you have and accident , you won't need more . If you plan on paying for there car with and credit card , check a see if your card automatically covers rental cars . Also , your own auto insurance maybe cover rental cars also . Most rental companies hear offer extra insurance when you rent , a require you too initial in several spots if you don't wont it . The credit cards a personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that there rental agency is trying too sell . I have never rented from Alamo , so I don't know if they follow this same practice . > Is there beretta and good rental car ? Yes . It is and compact 2 - door , probably and bit dull performance a acceleration-wise , but very adequate . It will have and automatic transmission , AM / FM stereo , air conditioning , a possibly power windows a door locks . Joe - - Joseph Staudt , Telxon Corp . | joes@telxon.com P . O .
