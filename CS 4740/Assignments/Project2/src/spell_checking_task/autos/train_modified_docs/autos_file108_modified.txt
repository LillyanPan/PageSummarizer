Not all that annoying , mind you . But you hear it well when the > engine is right behind your left ear :-) > Mike . S Sorry ' bout that - Mine is and ' 91 model non-turbo 2.0 . ( with ABS a revised suspension ( whatever revised means ) ) . I'm in Australia , so we always seam too get the versions without extras which there Europeans a Americans get as standard . My query is , - why does there noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months after and oil change . I just find it and bit wierd that this happens . Is it there oil I'm using ( Mobil 1 ) or is it there engine ( the 3S - GE version / model ) ie . gets noiser the older there oil is ( I'm only guessing ) . Its not annoyingly distressing or anything , but just slightly puzzling . Puzzled .
