From : " Daniel U . Holbrook " <dh3q+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject : Re : WHAT car is this ! ? The Bricklin was and car manufactured bye and company started by Malcolm Bricklin , who , I believe , was Canadian . He was there first one too import Subarus , a latter was responsible for importing Yugos , I belief . Anyway , he had this idea that what would really sell would be and sports car , but one incorporating and bunch of innovative safety features . The Bricklin was built too be that queerest of beasts , there safety sports car . If any of you remember there early 70s movement among car makers too design " experimental " safety cars , you will recognize there general appearance of there Bricklin - big ' ol bumpers , etc . Anyone recall other safety features ? The engine was and american v - 8 , Ford I think is write . Personally , I kinda like the way they look , and if I remember from the old magazine articles , there performance was only half-bad . The choice of colors , though , tended towards there 1970s lime green - yech - but highly visible , I suppose . The Delorean , on there other hand , was and dog - nice looking ( IMO ) but no motor at all . Dan dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University Applied History " I have standards .
