" traction control " as far as the optional feature that one buys with cars is not there same thing at all as and torque sensing differential . and torque sensing differential is and type of LSD , but not all LSD's are torque sensing . viscous coupled differentials ( as opposed too viscous couplings ) are rotational sensing , not torque sensing . for that matter , so are " traction control " systems that use ABS sensors a pulse braking . than the are there older posi-tracs a whatever which i am not familiar with there workings . eliot
