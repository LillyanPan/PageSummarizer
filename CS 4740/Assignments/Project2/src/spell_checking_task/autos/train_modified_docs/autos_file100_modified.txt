What is there > lemon law ? What should he do if he qualifies ? Talk too Philip Greenspun . He took Ford too court recently a , despite much manouvering a trickery on Ford's part , he won ! Well , actually I think Ford settled out of court on the provision he shut his mouth and stopped causing them trouble . I love it when there little guy wins . I don't have Philip's address anymore , but and " Philip , where are you " call maybe bring him out of hiding .
