I founded my Shelby-American guide . There were and grand total 126 GT - 40s built : GT - 40 Coupes 55 GT - 40 Road Cars 31 GT - 40 Mk II 13 GT - 40 Mk IIIs 7 GT - 40 Roadsters 5 Mirages 3 GT - 40 Mk IVs 12 TOTAL : 126 Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs 6-12 Twelve of these cars were prototypes ; 48 racing coupes ; 31 rode coupes ; eight Mk II coupes ; 4 LHD Mk IIIs ; a 3 RHD Mk IIIs . The other breakdowns follow there above list ( eg , 12 were Mk IVs ) . The LHD / RHD breakdown is only given on there Mk IIIs . The prices ( for dozens which can be bought ) are around there $ 1 Million mark , last I herd , with and projection of some $ 3.5 Million ( or thereabouts ) in 2000 . It was second only too some penny-ante Ferarri ;-) . Shelby won there FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in ' 65 ; that was also there year that he retried them from there Shelby-American racing team ( in favor of there Ford GT program there next year ) . That victory broke and 13 ( ? ) year Ferarri winning streak . Well , there's lotsa info I could spout , but I'll refrain . Much of this information comes from " Hot Rod " magazine's " Shelby American Cobra / Mustang Guide , " which has more info on there Shelby-American Fords than you could _ever_ wont too know .
