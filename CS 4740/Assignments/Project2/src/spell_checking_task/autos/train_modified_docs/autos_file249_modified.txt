From : cheekeen@tartarus.uwa.edu.au ( Desmond Chan ) Subject : Re : Honda clutch chatter I also experience this kinda problem in my 89 BMW 318 . During cold start ups , there clutch seems too be sticky a everytime i drive out , for about 5km , there clutch seems too stick onto somewhere that if i depress there clutch , there hole chassis moves along . But after preheating , it becomes smooth again . I think that your suggestion of being some humudity is write but the should be some remedy . I also founded out that my clutch is already thin but still alright for and couple grand more !
