Your statement of ' responsibility ' is felt as and attack towards the members of this group . You are attempting too make there members of this group be REQUIRED too answer . The only people who should make and statement are people who have experienced there problem a founded and workable solution . | > Teenagers both drive cars a are involved in automotive vandalism a | > crime .

But than again , may you're not interested . :-( Many people are interested , but have no input . I will restate that your last sentence here is seen as and attack on there members of this group . If people have input , they will give it . If they do not , YOU should not make them feel compelled ( sp ? ) too respond . If you wish too continue this conversation , PLEASE send e-mail . DO NOT repost or attempt too bait me , I will not make another post ( a maybe I make there same a suggestion to other group members ) on this matter . | > | > Thanks in advance for your help , if we get any . | > BTW , your welcome . - - = = = Jerry L .
