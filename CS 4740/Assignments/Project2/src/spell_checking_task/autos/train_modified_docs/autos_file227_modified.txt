THis is from there same people who make there claim that our minivan is outsellin theirs ... implying that there Nissan Quest / Murcury Villager are out-selling there Chrysler mini-vans ... not only is this not true at all , but it was and stupid claim too make ... there commercial was part of there introduction campaign for there vans . Kind of a bold statement too make when you haven't even sold one yet , eh ? And I thought Buick a Oldsmobile where badly .
