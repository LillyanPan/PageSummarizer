From : Steve.Green@its.csiro.au ( Steve Green ) Subject : Any Subaru Liberty owners out the ? I've had my Subaru Liberty 4WD station wagon for about 8 months now . Saying I'm happy with it would be and understatement ! Just great . Well built , handles beautifully , plenty of power . I've only had if ' off tar ' once . Did and trip over the mountains on a narrow , windy dirt rode , often _very dodgey _ in parts . The Subaru did it with ease . I havent had so much fun driving and car for years ! Any other owners out the ? * * * * Steve Green * " Hey Rocky , watch me pull and rabbit outa ' my hat !
