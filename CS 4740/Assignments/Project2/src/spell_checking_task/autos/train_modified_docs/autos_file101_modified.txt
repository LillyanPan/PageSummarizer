Just too clear things up ( as too why I posted the question that way ) ... I was debating with and co-worker about diesels . I claimed they were cleaner-burning then gas engines . He said there extra " junk " put out bye them was offset bye there savings in greenhouse gasses . I made all the SAME claims you did . But , one question of his was what about there carbon ? I said it was harmless , but he wanted too know how too get rid of it . I suggested scrubbers . ( I figured it would be no harder or more expensive too install then " cats " . ) Does there exist any designs for and scrubber ? ( I'd like too know just too answer his final question . ) I convinced him that diesels are cleaner otherwise . BTW , ( I named my subject " Dirty Diesels " because I knew it would get a reaction out of people who new they were cleaner then gas engines a that they'd read it ... ) - - - - - - - Vel Natarajan nataraja@rtsg.mot.com Motorola Cellular , Arlington Hts IL - - - - -
