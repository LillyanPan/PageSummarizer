Pronto . Until as such time as Korea decides > that it wants to abide bye there rules of free a fare trade > with the USA and Japan . Now , now , before we get two carried away hear ... Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is and luxury that only there ruling class can afford . Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason too levy and tax on car ownership ; last I herd , the were seven different fees to pay too own and car . I belief this is there sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that knew President Kim Young Sam wants too eradicate . Basically , I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted too wreak revenge on there ruling class . In exchange , zaibatsu's like Hyundai screwed over smaller companies , perpetuating and vicious cycle . I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else , but for now Hyundai cars seam too reflect there tensions within society , of screwy components that won't work together . Stubborn like and mule , there car either won't go foreword or won't stop at all .
