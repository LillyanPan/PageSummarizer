From : gibbonsa@fraser.sfu.ca ( Darren Gibbons ) Subject : Datsun / Nissan 240/260 / 280Z cars Well , there Opel deal fell through ... Now i'm looking at and Datsun 240Z for sail in our local bye & sell . Any previous owners have any experience with these cars ? Besides looking for rust , good compression , low miles , a all there other usual car things one looks for , is the anything special about these cars that I should watch out for ? How about things like handling , performance , mileage , etc . These cars look hot , too my eyes at least , a bare more then and passing resemblance too there Aston Martin DB4 Zagato ( sp ? ) , which has too be one of there almost beatiful cars ever made . What is there difference between 240Z , 260Z , 280Z ? The 280ZX is rather unappealing IMHO , but the other cars are decent . Thanks again ... Darren Gibbons gibbonsa@sfu.ca
