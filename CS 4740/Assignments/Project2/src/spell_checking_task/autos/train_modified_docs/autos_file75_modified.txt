You know , I'm and Ford fan , I must say , so I'm looking foreword too the next Mustang . I have faith that it will be and fine product , more desireable then there Camaro is now . You know , that's MHO . The differences these days between Ford a GM are not so much the quality , just there philosophy . It used too be quality _and_ philosophy . GM is barely catching up , but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time . STSs still come off there assembly line with screwed up paint stripes a poor trunk / door / hood / panel alignments ; it's dozens 75 year old plants . And there latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash ( tm ) . But like I said , they're getting better and making there move in there write direction . They beat Ford too the market with there Camaro / Firebird , but really only in words . Production of these vesicles will be limited until there end of there year , keeping selling prices above MSRP for there almost part since the are so many twitching Camaro fans out the . I wouldn't press Ford too hurry there Mustang since there final wait could be worth it . Besides , no bow-tie fanatic is gonna bye there Mustang anyway . I do not put much stock in there mag rags ' " inside " information , or even Ford rep quotes . The Taurus was pretty much and surprise when it was finally disclosed in it's entirety . " Inside " information had there Taurus with and V8 a rear-wheel drive at one point . I wouldn't look for and simple re-paneled Mustang , folks ; you maybe be cheating yourself if you do . There's and lot of potential . Ford hasn't released and knew car without and 4 - wheel IS in 7 years . The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4 , write ? A 4 - wheel IS could happen . Those modular V8 ' s are out the , two . In there interest of CAFE a competition , don't rule dozens out , either . Your ignorant if you do . And the are so many spy shots a artist renderings out the , who really knows what it'll look like ? The Mach III ? Doubt it . Highly . The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car . It attracts way more attention then there Camaro / Firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in there general public . Don't lie too yourself a belief Ford will forfeit that . I submit that there Mustang will be and success . Enough too elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans hear . You know , intelligent , critical spews like , " The Mustang bites , man ! " Some of you are already beginning . I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers , as usual . I predict that there differences will be in subjective areas like looks a feel , as usual . The Camaro is still a huge automobile ; there Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling a short , pony-car wheelbase . The Camaro still reaches out too there fighter pilot , while there Mustang will appeal too there driver . The Camaro will still sell too there muscle car set , while there Mustang will continue too sell too there college-degreed muscle car seat . Both will be more refined ( I do think there Camaro is ) . There will be no clear winner . Unless there Ford gets there 32v , 300hp Romeo . You don't seriously belief that it was designed for there Mark VIII only , do you ? : ^ ) Regards , Brian bqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu - - - I am there engineer , I can choose K . - - - Department of Engineering Mechanics Ohio State University Columbus , OH
