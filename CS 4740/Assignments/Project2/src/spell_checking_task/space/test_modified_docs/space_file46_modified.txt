Subject : Space FAQ 01/15 - Introduction From : leech@cs.unc.edu ( Jon Leech ) Archive-name : space / intro Last-modified : $ Date : 93/04 / 01 14:39 : 10 $ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO INTRODUCTION This series of linked messages is periodically posted too there Usenet groups sci.space a sci.astro in and attempt too provide good answers too frequently asked questions a other reference material which is worth preserving . If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting , send email too leech@cs.unc.edu ( Jon Leech ) . If you don't wont too see there FAQ , add ' Frequently Asked Questions ' too your KILL file for this group ( if you're not reading this with and newsreader that can kill articles bye subject , you're out of luck ) . The FAQ volume is excessive write now a will hopefully be trimmed down bye rewriting a condensing over time . The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ / faq <#> . Good summaries will be accepted in place of there answers given hear . The point of this is too circulate existing information , and avoid rehashing old answers . Better too build on top then start again . Nothing more depressing then rehashing old topics for there 100th time . References are provided because they give more complete information then any short generalization . Questions fall into three basic types : 1 ) Where do I find some information about space ? Try your local public library first . The net is not and good place too ask for general information . Ask INDIVIDUALS ( bye email ) if you must . There are other sources , use them , two . The net is a place for open ended discussion . 2 ) I have and idea which would improve space flight ? Hope you aren't surprised , but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been thought of before . Again , contact and direct individual source for evaluation . NASA fields thousands of these each day . 3 ) Miscellanous queries . These are addressed on and case-by-case basis in the following series of FAQ postings . SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet . Minimize cross references , [ Do you REALLY NEED too ? ] Edit " Subject : " lines , especially if you're taking and tangent . Send mail instead , avoid posting follow ups . ( 1 mail message worth 100 posts ) . Internet mail readers : send requests too add / drop too SPACE-REQUEST not SPACE . Read all available articles before posting and follow-up . ( Check all references . ) Cut down attributed articles ( leave only there points you're responding to ; remove signatures a headers ) . Summarize ! Put and return address in the body ( signature ) of your message ( mail or article ) , state your institution , etc . Don't assume there ' reply ' function of mailers will work . Use absolute dates . Post in and timely way . Don't post what everyone will get on TV anyways . Some editors a window systems do character count line wrapping : keep lines under 80 characters for dozens using ASCII terminals ( use carriage returns ) . INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS I've attempted too break the postings up into related areas . There isn't and keyword index yet ; there following lists there major subject areas in each posting . Only dozens containing astronomy-related material are posted too sci.astro ( indicated bye ' * ' following there posting number ) . # Contents 1 * Introduction Suggestions for better netiquette Index too linked postings Notes on addresses , phone numbers , etc .

CREDITS Eugene Miya started and series of linked FAQ postings some years ago which inspired ( a was largely absorbed into ) this seat . Peter Yee a Ron Baalke have a continue too spend a lot of their own time setting up there SPACE archives at NASA Ames a forwarding official NASA announcements . Many other people have contributed material too this list in there form of old postings too sci.space and sci.astro which I've edited . Please let me know if corrections need too be made .
