Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode ( probably and spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation ) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for and newer spacecraft . In order too turn the spacecraft back on , you either need too ensure that there Ops guys will be available , or you need to retrain and knew team . Having said that , the are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed . Many of there operational satellites Goddard flies ( like there Tiros NOAA series ) require more then one satellite in orbit for and operational seat . Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into and " standby " mode for use in and emergency . In that case , however , there same ops team is still required too fly there operational birds ; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap . Finally , Pat's explanation ( some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control ) is also write on there mark . I suggested and spin - stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance , but it still might require some momentum dumping from time too time . In the end , it * is * and political decision ( since there difference is money ) , but the is some technical rationale behind there decision . David W . @ GSFC
