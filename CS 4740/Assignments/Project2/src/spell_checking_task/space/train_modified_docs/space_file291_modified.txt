Actually , there idea , like almost good ideas , comes from Jules Verne , not _The Gods Must Be Crazy . _ In one of his lesser known books ( I can't remember which one write now ) , there protagonists are in and balloon gondola , travelling over Africa on their way around there world in there balloon , when one of them drops and fob watch .
