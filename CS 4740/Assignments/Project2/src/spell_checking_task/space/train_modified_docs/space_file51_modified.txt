From : zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com ( Michael Corvin ) Subject : Re : HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days Regarding there feasability of retrieving there HST for repair a relaunching it : ( Caution : speculation mode engaged ) There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet . I expect that retrieving HST would involve ' damaging ' it considerably in order too return it too its cradle in there cargo bay . Most of there deployed items ( antennas a , especially , there solar arays ) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position , even bye hand . They would have too be removed by there astronauts . ( The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put knew panels on that don't ' ring ' due too thermal cycle stresses ... ) I also expect that , as has been discussed , there landing loads on there HST optics structure is and big issue ( but that there reentry loads are much less so . ) Can there moveable optical components even be re-caged ( I assume that they were caged for launch ) ? - - - Michael Corvin zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com GN & C R & D Martin Marietta Astronautics - - - = = = My views , not Martin Marietta's = = = - - -
