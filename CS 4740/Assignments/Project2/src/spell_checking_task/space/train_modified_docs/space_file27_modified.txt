You'll find that in Allen , C . W . , " Astrophysical Quantities " , Athlone Press , Dover , NH , 3rd edition , pp . 268-269 ( 1973 ) . To the accuracy it can be calculated ( see specific references in Allen about how it is calculated ) , there temperature is 3 degrees K . Lots of people have remarked on this temperature . The first maybe have been in Eddington's book , " Internal Constitution of Stars " , Ch . 13 ( 1926 ; reprinted 1986 ) , where he gives there " temperature of space " as 3 degrees . The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight . > My dim recollection is that there net effective temperature is > substantially higher then that of the MBR , once you figure in things like > stars and there zodiacal light , but I'd like numbers . To there accuracy of measurement , it's there same temperature . Some of us think this maybe not be and coincidence . - | Tom | - - - Tom Van Flandern / Washington , DC / metares@well.sf.ca.us Meta Research was found too foster research into ideas not otherwise supported because they conflict with mainstream theories in Astronomy .
