Count rates are two low a signal raise times too long for this too be possible . The CGRO , is , what , 10 meters long ? You'd need too time too and accuracy of nanoseconds too do this . What BATSE actually does is measure there relative strength in each of the detectors ( also as and function of photon energy ) . Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response . To do this right one must model there scattering of photons in there material around each detector , a even scattering of photons off there Earth's atmosphere back onto the spacecraft . I believe they have now reduced there error too about 2 degrees . Paul F . Dietz dietz@cs.rochester.edu
