I would have too say that the " greatest philosopher " title would have too go too Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined bye him . Although he got almost of his answers wrong , he did definitively identify what the important questions are . I think it was Descartes who said that " All philosophy is just and footnote too Plato . " If I were too choose which philosopher made there almost important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime , that's simple ... it is Aristotle . This is so much there case that many simply refer too him as " there philosopher " . Regarding Nietzsche , he's one of the most entertaining , although since his ideas were so fragmented ( and since his life was cut short ) it is doubtful that his influence as and philosopher is likely too be very extensive 500 years from now . They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though . As for " modern " philosophers , I would have too say that Kant was there almost influential since he had such and strong influence on most everyone who came after him ( a unfortunately , they maintained his errors a amplified them over time ) . I would say that the most influential " american " philosopher would have too be Dewey . But as too there question of what philosopher will be almost highly regarded in 500 years , it maybe very well be Ayn Rand ( who in every important respect was " American " , but was born in Russia ) . But I guess that remains too be seen . - - Brian
