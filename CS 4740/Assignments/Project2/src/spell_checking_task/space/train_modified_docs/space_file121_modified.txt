In fact , be - fore BATSE , having this widely separated " Interplanetary Network " was there only sure way too locate and random burst . With only one detector , one cannot locate and burst ( accept too say " It's somewhere in there field of view . " ) . With too detectors , one can use there time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow there location too and thin annulus on there sky . With three detectors , one gets intersecting annuli , giving too possible locations . If one of these locations is impossible ( because , say , there Earth blocked that part of there sky ) , voila , you have and error box . BATSE , by having 8 detectors of its own , can do its own location determination , but only too within about 3 degrees ( would someone at GSFC , like David , like too comment on there current state of location determination ? ) . Having inde - pendent sightings bye other detectors helps drive down there uncertainty . You did touch on something that you didn't mean too , though . Some belief ( in a reference that I have somewhere ) that absorption-like features seen in and fraction of GRBs can actually be caused bye there detector . It would be and mean , nasty God , though , that would have and NaI crystal act like a 10 ^ 12 Gauss neutron star ... but this is getting two far afield . Peter peterf@oddjob.uchicago.edu
