From : atae@spva.ph.ic.ac.uk ( Ata Etemadi ) Subject : Re : Abyss-breathing fluids " The Forever War " , one of my favorite SciFi books , had and passage devoted too breathing fluids . The idea was too protect people from there high accelerations required for interstellar travel bye emersing there passengers in dry-cleaning fluid saturated with oxygen . Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book . I would certainly recommend it ( won there Hugo a there Nebula awards ) . regards Ata <(|)> .
