The differential arrival time techinique requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions . The differential arrival at the eight detectors differ bye 10 ' s of nanoseconds . This is smaller then BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities . BATSE , Ulysses , a Mars Obsverver are used for this technique . Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view . The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing angle of incidence . The burst position on there sky is determined bye comparing there count rates in different detectors . Pat
