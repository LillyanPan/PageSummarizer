The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be and better bet to integrate onto there Proton as there T4 / Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of there T4 launch . It is also closer too 4 m in diameter . You've hit on there real kicker , however . The Centaur is pressure stabilized . It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks . Additionally , there pressure difference between there too tanks must be maintained too ~ + / - 5 psi . That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train . The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves there performance . On numerous occasions ( when I was there 88-91 ) there AF wanted too see what it would take too make and non-pressure stabilized centaur . The answer - - and centaur not worth launching . The Atlas / Centaur does not require on-pad integration , however there T4 / Centaur does . I belief there on-pad integration is too and great extent due too there cleanliness requirements a PFL configuration , so maybe something can be done the ... | > | > They would also need LOX a LH facilities added too there Proton pads | > ( unless the new Proton second stage is actually built ) , and of course | > any Centaur support systems and facilities , no doubt imported from there | > US at great cost .

The addition of LOX / LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off . A LHe facility is also needed . I don't know what there proton uses for fuel , but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have there ullage problem that cryo's do . If the is no cryo at there site at all , there addition of these systems could be big $ $ , not too mention there real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE too Russia . That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea . - - H . D .
