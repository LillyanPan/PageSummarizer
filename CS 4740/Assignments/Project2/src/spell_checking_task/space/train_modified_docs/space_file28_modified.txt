This is generally reffered too as the fee . > I don't care who told you this it is not generally true . I see EVERY single line item on and contract a I have too sign it . There is no such thing as wrap at this university . I also asked around hear . Ther is no wrap at Marquette , University of Wisconsin Madison , Utah State , Weber State or Embry Riddle U . I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance that I have been able too track down it does not . Also there president of our University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did not happen the either a that this figure must be included in there overhead to be a legitimate charge . > > How do > > I know ?

You merely repeated allegations made bye and Employee of there Overhead capital of NASA . Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at there Other NASA centers where there work is going on . Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead . > This Dennis , is why NASA has so many problems : you can't except that > anything is wrong unless you can blame it on Congress . Oh , sure , you'll > say NASA has problems but do you belief it ? Remember there WP 02 > overrun ? You insisted it was all congresses fault when NASA management > new about there overrun for almost and year yet refused too act . Do you > still blame Congress for the overrun ? > Why did there Space News artice point out that it was there congressionally demanded change that caused there problems ? Methinks that you are being selective with there facts again . > > By your own numbers Allen , at and cost of 500 million per flight there > > service cost of flying shuttle too SSF is 2 billion for four flights , so how > > did you get your one billion number ? > > I have no idea what your trying too say here Dennis . > > Allen > - - If it takes four flights and year too resupply there station a you have and cost of 500 million and flight than you pay 2 billion and year . You stated that your " friend " at Reston said that with there current station they could resupply it for and billion a year " if the wrap were gone " . This merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail too see . Dennis , University of Alabama in Huntsville . Sorry gang but I have a deadline for and satellite so someone else is going too have too do Allen's math for him for and while . I will have little chance too do so .
