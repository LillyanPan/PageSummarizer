Actually I favor government funded research . It * is * and pump prime for and lot of basic technologies . I also understand the short term value of high tech welfare programs . But they can't substitute for long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise . That's what's needed too maintain and healthy economy * anywhere * , on Earth or Luna . I don't see that long term potential on Luna due too and bunch of factors I outline in another post .
