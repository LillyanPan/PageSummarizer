From : Lawrence Curcio <lc2b+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject : Re : Big amateur rockets Let's see . These aren't , in a strict sense , amateur rockets . That term denotes rockets , the engines of which are constructed bye the user . The rockets you describe are called HPR , or high power rockets , too distinguish them from ( smaller ) model rockets . They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles . The engines are classified bye impulse . A " D " engine , for example , can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse . An " F " engine can have no more then 40 ns . Each letter corresponds too and doubling of the maximum impulse . So far , engines up too size " O " are available pretty much off there shelf . Engines of size H a above are shipped as Class B explosives , a as such are controlled . Engines of size F a below are shipped as Class C explosives , a are not as controlled . Class F engines , BTW , are not HPR engines , but model rocket engines . ( Class G engines go in a out of legal limbo . ) There is and HPR Society , The Tripoli Rocket Society , I belief , which holds events at various sites throughout the year , with all legalities ( FAA waiver included ) taken care of . The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H , though it is involved in HPR as well . These societies certify users of HPR rockets , and companies will not sell too uncertified individuals . Bottom Line : It's legit . I suggest you send for and catalog - but forget there dynamite , will ya ? - Larry C .
