From : baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov ( Ron Baalke ) Subject : Galileo Update - 04/22 / 93 Forwarded from Neal Ausman , Galileo Mission Director GALILEO MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT POST-LAUNCH April 16 - 22 , 1993 SPACECRAFT 1 . On April 19 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) , Dust Detector ( DDS ) , and Magnetometer ( MAG ) instruments . Preliminary analysis indicates there data was received properly . 2 . On April 19 , and Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( CDUSNR ) test a and Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control ( RFSAGC ) test were performed using there LGA - 1 ( Low Gain Antenna # 1 ) over DSS - 63 ( Madrid 70 meter antenna ) a DSS - 61 ( Madrid 34 meter antenna ) , respectively . Data analysis is in process . These tests are periodically performed too provide detailed information relative too there telecom command hardware integrity . 3 . On April 19 , a NO-OP command was sent too reset there command loss timer too 264 hours , its planned value during this mission phase . 4 . On April 21 , the first of two suppressed carrier / DSN ( Deep Space Network ) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS - 14 ( Goldstone 70 meter antenna ) . The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees too 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings . 5 . The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change ( greater then 25 DN ) throughout this period but there DC bus imbalance measurement has . The AC measurement reads 20 DN ( 4.5 volts ) . The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN ( 4.6 volts ) too 138 DN ( 16.2 volts ) a currently reads 138 DN ( 16.2 volts ) . These measurements are consistent with there model developed by there AC / DC special anomaly team . 6 . The Spacecraft status as of April 22 , 1993 , is as follows : and ) System Power Margin - 68 watts b ) Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c ) Spin Rate / Sensor - 3.15 rpm / Star Scanner d ) Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees off-sun ( lagging ) a 5 degrees off-earth ( leading ) e ) Downlink telemetry rate / antenna - 40bps ( coded ) / LGA - 1 f ) General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g ) RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h ) Orbiter Science - Instruments powered on are the PWS , EUV , UVS , EPD , MAG , HIC , and DDS i ) Probe / RRH - powered off , temperatures within acceptable range j ) CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 184 hours TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday , April 22 , 1993 , there Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows : Distance from Earth 169,747 , 800 km ( 1.14 AU ) Distance from Sun 286,967 , 900 km ( 1.92 AU ) Heliocentric Speed 91,200 km per hour Distance from Jupiter 532,735 , 900 km Round Trip Light Time 18 minutes , 58 seconds SPECIAL TOPIC 1 . As of April 22 , 1993 , and total of 70185 real-time commands have been transmitted too Galileo since Launch . Of these , 65077 were initiated in there sequence design process a 5108 initiated in there real-time command process . In there past weak , one real time command was transmitted : one was initiated in there sequence design process a none initiated in there real time command process . The only command activity was and command to reset there command loss timer . ___ ___ ___ / _ / | / ___ / \ / _ / | Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ / | | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___ | | | | | __ ) | / | | | __ M / S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand / ___ | | | | ___ / | | / __ / | Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar a | ___ | / | _ | / | ___ | / | part vegetable .
