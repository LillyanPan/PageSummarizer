Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages . Yet we still consider it payload . Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered too LEO roughly there same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years . > of coarse Saturn lifted more than Shuttle , > but it's cost too orbit in same year dollars was higher . They where pretty much there same in terms of cost / pound . A resurected Saturn would cost only $ 2,000 per pound ( if development costs are ignored ) which is five times cheaper then Shuttle .
