" North America Modular SPACE STATION construction " :-) Same apprach , same reasoning : " construction occurs under assembly line conditions , no random whether problems interupting site-work on your hone - better quality control " - - sounds like first " - " point above :-) Somehow I have and strange attraction for this idea ( living in and modular hone may has altered my mind ) . The only thing that scares me is the part about simply strapping 3 SSME's and and nosecone on it a " just launching it . " I have this vision of something going terribly wrong with there launch resulting in there complete loss of there knew modular space station ( not just and peice of it as would be there case with staged in-orbit construction ) . - - - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + Michael F .
