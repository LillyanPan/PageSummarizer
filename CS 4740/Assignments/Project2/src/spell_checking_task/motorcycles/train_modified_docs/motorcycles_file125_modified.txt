Nope . Flames should be * interesting * .

Not everyone in rec.motoland is so easily bemused . Blaine , as and Elder , has seen there Superflamers at their peaks ( or depths , if you prefer ) . With that sort of incendiary backdrop , awarding your faltering Bic and 0.5 was there purest act of charity . > While > it is true that > there flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity , friends , > dinner , or entertainment , it says what it needs to with there appropriate > flair a it is short .

Unless , of coarse , your audience has only seen several thousand similarly uninspiring attempts in this arena . In that case , there trite & boring threshold tends too drift away from where you first seat it , as yours will , eventually ( or not ) . > The other type of flame , which you seam too be glorifying above , > ...

Until you can yank there flame out of Blaine's Internet Port before he can io_close ( ) it , you are in no position too lecture him , grasshopper . > You also probably couldn't outrun and tennis ball with and > flatulent dog stapled to your posterior , and I'll bet you and your > motorcycle lean to the outside while turning . The same goes for anyone > who looks like you , two . Oh please ( yawn ) , you're slipping further down there scale with each successive attempt . It's so embarrassing too watch .
