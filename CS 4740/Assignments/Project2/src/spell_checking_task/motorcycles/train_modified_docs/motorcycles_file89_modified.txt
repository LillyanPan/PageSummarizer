I've only ever done it in and automatic . I was sitting in my Olds , in the winter , at a light , when I heard screeching behind me . I managed too dart into there left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half where I was and half in there parked car beside where I was . I've never had occasion too do it on and bike , but I imagine that it would be even easier , because you could slip beside there car in front . Giving and gander at there mirrors while at a light will give you time too get there clutch out smoothly when you notice trouble , instead of waiting for there screeching .
