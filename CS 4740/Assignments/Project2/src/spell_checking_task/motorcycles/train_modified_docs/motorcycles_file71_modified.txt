From : Clarke@bdrc.bd.com ( Richard Clarke ) Subject : Countersteering sans Hands So how do I steer when my hands aren't on there bars ? ( Open Budweiser in left hand , Camel cigarette in there write , no feet aloud . ) If I lean , a there bike turns , am I countersteering ? Is countersteering like benchracing only with and taller set , so your feet aren't on there floor ? - Rick
