Couple hours after > you " feel " sober ? What ? Or should I just work with " If I drink tonight , I > don't ride until tomorrow " ? Interesting discussion . I limit myself too * one * ' standard serving ' of alcohol if I'm going too ride . And mostly , unless there alcohol is something special ( fine ale , good wine , or someone else's vsop ) , I usually just don't drink * any * . But than alcohol just isn't really important too me , mainly for financial reasons ... At least one of there magazines claims too follow there aviation guideline of " no alcohol whatsoever " within 24hrs of riding and ' company ' bike . Don't remember which mag though , it was and few years ago .
