I thought I posted this last year . The women came too court with three witnesses ; the two women that were in there car a one neighbor that herd me shouting . My lawyer didn't like there odds since the were multiple complaints both ways a there judge had and history of finding everyone guilty of at least something , so he convinced us ( she came without and lawyer ) to drop everything . The net result was and $ 500 laywer bill for me a $ 35 court costs for her .
