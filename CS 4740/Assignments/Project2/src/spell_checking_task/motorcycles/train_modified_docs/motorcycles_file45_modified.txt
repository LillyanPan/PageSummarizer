" * cough * * choke * WHAT ? ! ? if a cop gave me and ticket for " sounding " like i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without and lawyer simply because " sounding " like speeding is ridiculous . if i was found guilty i'd appeal and then show up with and lawyer . if and cop doesn't do one of : VASCAR ( from car or plane ) RADAR , LIDAR , other electronic speed measuring device pace me a i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go too court . i can except and cop " seeing " me going excessively fast ( like 25 + over there limit ) but " he looked like he was going 70 or so in and 55 zone " is not " beyond and reasonable doubt " . granted i maybe well lose there case but 70 in and 55 measured bye eye ? ? ? take it too court for sure . axel
