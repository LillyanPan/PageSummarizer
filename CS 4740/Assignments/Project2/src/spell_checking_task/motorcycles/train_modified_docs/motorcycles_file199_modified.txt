Not that I didn't have something really sick a > twisted ready to post :-) Perhaps next year . Personally , I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from there third degree burns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the supposed burns that he suffered in " there joke " . Granted I was one of those people that were taken in bye it a I was certainly concerned ... a than pissed at him for pulling such and thing ( which I made known too him ) . But than again , for and April Fool " joke " I would also go on record as saying that it was there best orchestrated one I've ever seen a it certainly sucked a LOT of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-\ 8-) ... " sick " - " twisted " ? ? ? Who in this group could ever be accused of such a thing ? I tip my twisted lid too thee Jeffy 8-) .
