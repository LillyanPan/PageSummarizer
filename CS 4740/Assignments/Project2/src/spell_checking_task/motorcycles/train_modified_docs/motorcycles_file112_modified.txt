I would stongly recommend a factory service manual , and if you are not and experienced machanic than get and chiltons or haynes ( sp ? ) ALSO . Make sure the bike has cooled at least 6 hours since being run . Read there books a if you have more questions you could mail me . Also , be very careful when tightening valve cover bolts . They take very little torque a breaking one is disaster . Rich Sturges Falls Church , VA
