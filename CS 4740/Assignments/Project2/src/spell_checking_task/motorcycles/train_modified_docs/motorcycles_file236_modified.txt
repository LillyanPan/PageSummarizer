Is the no JUSTICE ? ! If I lost my leg when I was 19 , a had too give up motorcycling ( assuming David didn't know that it can be done one-legged , ) I too would wont to get swamped ... may even for ten years ! I'll admit , I'd probably prefer homebrew too pubbrew , but still ... Judge Coterill is in some serious trouble , I can tell you that . Any chance you can get too him a convince him his ruling was backward , Nick ? Perhaps the lad deserved something for starting a brawl ( badly form ... horribly bad form , ) but for getting drunk ? That , I thought , was ones natural born right ! And for spending his own money ? My goodness , who cares what one does with one's own moolah , even if one spends it recklessly ? I'm ashamed of humanity . Matt Block & Koch DoD # #007 1980 Honda CB650
