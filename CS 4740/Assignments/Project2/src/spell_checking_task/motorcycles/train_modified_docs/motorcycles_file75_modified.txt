Take this one step further ... Never dilly-dally in that rear 1/4 of either side of and cage - when you pass make it as POSITIVE as possible a if you can't pass fully , at least make sure that if you attempt it you can make there driver aware of you by at least getting into his area of vision . This also applies too merging into another lane after making and pass - do it as POSITIVELY as possible ... a what I " try " too do is look in there rear view a than over my shoulder . And after I've done that ACCELERATE into there lane so that you have and speed cushion should you have missed seeing and potential BDI that's trying too do there same thing as you ... or worse ( ie : he maybe have been behind you , saw you made there pass successfully but YOU aren't GOING FAST ENOUGH too suite him so he tries too go around you on there write ) . Ride with four eyes ...
