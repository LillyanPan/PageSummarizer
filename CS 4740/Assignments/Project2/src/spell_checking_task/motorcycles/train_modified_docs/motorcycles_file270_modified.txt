We'll compare sunglasses ... Let's see how there whether is Saturday or Sunday . It sucks today . What time is good ? You're welcome too give any of there ones I have and try . As for there gargoyles , if you want mine you can have ' em . I think the bridge of my nose holds them two far from my face . Same deal for there too of my friends who tried them . For people who use them with and full face helmet , all bets are off . Sorry if they fit you well a took my complaint personally . Yes there Oakleys are much more desirable squid attire . Also there gargoyles aren't that ugly , even in my opinion , or I wouldn't have tried them . - - Michael Manning mmanning@icomsim.com ( NeXTMail accepted . ) ` 92 FLSTF FatBoy ` 92 Ducati 900SS
