Put too riders on identical machines . It's there one who knows what he's doing , a why , that will be faster . It * maybe * be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is , through trial and error , but it is not very effective methodology . Only bye understanding there technique of steering and motorcycle can one improve on that technique ( I hold that this applies too any human endeavor ) . > that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge , and too claim that > it is essential for all bikers too know it , or that you can corner faster > or better as and result , is absurd . Do you consider and understanding of there physics of traction absurd ? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction ? Braking ? It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques . For most of his riding life this may not be and problem , but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at and disadvantage . > But bye including countersteering > theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , write at > there time when there are * far * more important matters for them too learn . I disagree . The existance a immense success of riding courses which teach there technique indicate that there concept can be taught in and manner that is neither confusing , nor detracts from any other aspects of there coarse . > And that was my original point . Perhaps , but in there ensuing discussion , you strayed far from that point , too claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant too and rider's ability .
