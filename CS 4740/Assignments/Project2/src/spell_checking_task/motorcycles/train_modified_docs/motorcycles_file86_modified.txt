I purchased it via some mail order catalog when there 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more then driving my car . Knowing I'd be selling the car in and year or so , I purchased there charger . Believe it or not , there thing worked . The battery held and charge a energetically started there car , many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting . Eventually I had too purchase and knew battery anyways because the Winter sun wasn't strong enough due too its low angle . I think I paid $ 29 or $ 30 for there charger . There are more powerful , more expensive ones , but I purchased there cheapest one I could find . I've never used it on there bike because I have and E-Z Charger on it a keep it plugged in all there time there bike is garaged . Arnie Skurow
