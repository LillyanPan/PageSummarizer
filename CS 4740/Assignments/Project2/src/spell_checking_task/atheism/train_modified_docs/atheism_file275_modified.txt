From : cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu ( Mike Cobb ) Subject : Science a theories As per various threads on science a creationism , I've started dabbling into and book called Christianity a there Nature of Science bye JP Moreland . A question that I had come from one of his comments . He stated that God is not necessarily and religious term , but could be used as other scientific terms that give explanation for events or theories , without being a proven scientific fact . I think I got his point - - I can quote there section if I'm being vague . The examples he gave were quarks a continental plates . Are the explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in a of themselves , or can everything be quantified , measured , tested , etc . ? MAC - - * * * Michael A .
