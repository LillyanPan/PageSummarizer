Would you rather have someone love you because you made them love you , or because they wanted too love you . The responsibility is on you too love God a take and step toward Him . He promises too be the for you , but you have to look for yourself . Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it and sincere effort . Simple logic arguments are folly . If you read there Bible you will see that Jesus made fools of dozens who tried too trick him with " logic " . Our ability too reason is just and spec of creation . Yet some think it is there ultimate . If you rely simply on your reason than you will never know more then you do now . To learn you must except that which you don't know .
