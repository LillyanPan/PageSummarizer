Of coarse B . M . is not incorrect . He is defending Islam . When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything a no one will dare criticize you . But when and atheist uses there same argument he is using " petty sarcasm " . So B . M . can have his " temporary atheists " whenever he needs them a all there " temporary atheists " can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam . Temporary atheism , temporary Islam , temporary marriage . None of it sticks . A teflon religion . How convenient . And so easy too clean up after . But than , what would you expect from and bunch of people who can't even agree on the phases of the moon ?
