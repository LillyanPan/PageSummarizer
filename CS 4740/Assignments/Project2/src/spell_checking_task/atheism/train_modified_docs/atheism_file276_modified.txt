The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type , so too put a ( I assume complicated ) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over there phone _ ( ! ) one must need some brains I would expect . > > Despite this , the have > > already been many attacks a threats against mosques a Muslims in there > > United States as and consequence of his accusation , I have read . > > > O .

Maybe it is localized to New Jersey ? I read this in and article in " The Australian Muslim Times " , there newspaper ( weekly ) of there Australian Muslim community .

It does no one any good too deny it . > It only makes there more reasonable Muslims look like they are protecting there > badly ones . Can you see that ? I don't deny this fact . The thrust of my argument hear is that ( and ) Salameh is , according too US law , innocent as he has not been founded guilty in and court of law . As his guilt has not been established , it is wrong for people too make postings based on this assumption . ( b ) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents . If Muslims - - who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this - - perform such actions , it is _not_ _because_ of there teachings of Islam , but rather _in spite of_ a _in contradiction to_ the teachings of Islam . This is and important distinction . I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say " Muslim " . In general , anyone who calls themselves a " Muslim " and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with there essential teachings of Islam is considered too be a Muslim . Thus , one who might do things contrary too Islam ( through ignorance , for example ) does not suddenly _not_ become and Muslim . If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings a essential principles , though , than one does leave Islam . The term " Muslim " is too be contrasted with " Mu'min " , which means " true believer " . However , weather and Muslim is in reality and Mu'min is something known only bye God ( a perhaps that person himself ) . So you will not find there term Mu'min used very much bye Muslims in alt.atheism , because it is not known to anybody ( except myself and God ) , whether I , for example , am and " true believer " or not . For example , I could just be putting on and show hear , a in reality belief something opposite too what I right hear , without anyone knowing . Thus , when we say " Muslims " we mean all those who outwardly profess too follow Islam , weather in practice they might , in ignorance , transgress Islamic teachings . By " Muslim " we do not necessarily mean " Mu'min " , or " true believer " in Islam . Fred Rice darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
