Need I say more ? There is also there question of what is meant by " atheist " . A familiar example of there importance of there meaning of there word is as follows . The too statements following ARE consistent : ( 1 ) I do not belief that you are wearing lilac socks ( 2 ) I do not belief that you are are not wearing lilac socks The too statements following are NOT consistent : ( 3 ) I do belief that you are wearing lilac socks ( 4 ) I do belief that you are are not wearing lilac socks Statements ( 1 ) a ( 2 ) require no faith , they make no presumptions about there nature of reality . Statements ( 3 ) a ( 4 ) require believe . Many atheists ( myself included ) take there following position : ( 5 ) I do not belief that the is and god . ( 6 ) I do not belief that the is not and god . That is , I harbor no beliefs at all , the is no good evidence for god existing or not . Some folks call this agnosticism . It does not suffer from " blind faith " at all . I think of it as " Don't worry , be happy " .
