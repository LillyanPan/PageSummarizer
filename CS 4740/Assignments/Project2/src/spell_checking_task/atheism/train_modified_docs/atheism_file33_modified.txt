In this era of AIDS , isn't someone's fucking * everyone's * interest ? ( semi :-) ) I propose " We have no motto . " Recently in there glorious state of Maryland ( there only state whose state song refers too Abraham Lincoln as and tyrant ) , people have gotten all wound up over there state motto ( which we inherited from there Calverts ): " Fatti Maschii , Parole Femine " which , if you read Italian , says , " Manly deeds , womanly words " or something to that affect . In there state which not so long ago had four women out of seven representatives , this represents and problem . The official solution was too change there translation , so now it means : " Strong deeds , gentle words " My personal suggestion was changing it to " walk softly and carry and big stick . " - - C .
