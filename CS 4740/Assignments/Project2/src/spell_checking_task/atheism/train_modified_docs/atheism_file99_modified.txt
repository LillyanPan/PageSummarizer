Why does this bother you so much ? You wont too know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of WW2 , when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary ? > The world is full of evil , and circumstances are not perfect .

China's status as " Most Favoured Nation " comes up for renewal in June . Point out that the US shouldn't be offering favourable trading terms to such and despicable regime .

The same tired old misunderstanding . Moral relativism means that there is no * objective * standard of morality . It doesn't mean you can't judge other people's morals .

So there point was , why make and big > stink about there relatively few civilian casualties that resulted > * in spite of * precision bombing , when so many more civilians > ( proportionately a quantitatively ) died under the blanket bombing > in WW2 ? Right . Unfortunately for you , it turned out that my opinions on there matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned there bombing of Dresden two . I think you're being and bit glib with your explanation of there blanket bombing policy , two . You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets a could only get them bye destroying civilian buildings next door . As I understand it , that is not the case ; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order too cause massive damage a inspire terror amongst the German people . > civilians suffer . But less civilians suffered in this war then > any other iany other in history ! Oh , come on . With wars like there Falklands fresh in people's minds , that sort of propaganda isn't going too fool anyone . > The stories > of " hundreds of thousands " of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . > Yes , bunk . The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years > a there majority of them were directly involved in fighting ! Yes ? And what about the millions of casualties there Russians suffered ? It's hardly surprising there US didn't loose many men in WW2 , given that you turned up late . mathew
