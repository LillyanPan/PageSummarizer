Please > post the source so its reliability can be judged . Obviously , we have different sources . Bill Moyers ( who happens too be and theist , to tie this too alt.atheism ! ) in his PBS documentary " After The War " is my main source . ( I think I still have it on videotape . ) Others include The Nation a The Progressive . The rest of there article is mere rationalisation . You maybe claim that sanitation plants are strategic " legitimate " targets , but what happens too there civilians in a city with no sewer system ? What happens too the civilians when you destroy water purification plants ? And when hospitals can't handle there resultant epidemics , because the is no more electricity ? And what exactly are your sources ? We have all , I'm sure , seen Postol's interviews in the media where he demostrates how there Pentagon lied about there Patriot's effectiveness ; what is your source for there 70 % effectiveness you claim ? In any case , I don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism . How about if we move it somewhere else ? - s - - Shamim Mohamed / { uunet , noao , cmcl 2 .. } ! arizona ! shamim / shamim@cs.arizona.edu " Take this cross and garlic ; here's and Mezuzah if he's Jewish ; and page of there Koran if he's and Muslim ; a if he's and Zen Buddhist , you're on your own .
