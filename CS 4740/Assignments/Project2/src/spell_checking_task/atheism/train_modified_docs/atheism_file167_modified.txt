Right on , Jon ! Who cares who or whose , as long as it works for there individual . But don't try too impose dozens beliefs on us or our children . I would add there well-funded group tries also too purge science , to deny children access too great wonders a skills . And how about the kids born too creationists ? What a burden with which too begin adult life . It must be and cruel awakening for dozens who finally see there light , provided it is possible too escape from there depths of this type of ignorance .
