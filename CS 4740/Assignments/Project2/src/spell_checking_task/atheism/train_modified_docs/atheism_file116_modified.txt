It is all written in _The_Wholly_Babble : _the_Users_Guide_to_Invisible_ _Pink_Unicorns_ . To be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns , you must read there Babble , a obey what is written in it . To obey what is written in there Babble , you must belief that doing so is there way too be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns . To belief that obeying what is written in the Babble leads too believing in invisible pink unicorns , you must , essentially , belief in invisible pink unicorns . This bit of circular reasoning begs there question : What makes obeying different from believing ? - - qpliu@princeton.edu Standard opinion : Opinions are delta-correlated .
