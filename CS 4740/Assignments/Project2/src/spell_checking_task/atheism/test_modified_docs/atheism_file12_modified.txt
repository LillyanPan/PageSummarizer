Of coarse , if you're planning too pull a Rushdie than declaring one's leaving there religion is little too be concerned about compared too one's other plans . In Rushdie's case , there one under discussion , one can . It is tragic that in _some_ " Islamic " countries this is so . There are , however , Islamic countries ( whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is too be incorporated ) , e . g . Kuwait , where one can freely make such statements without fear . > Not too mention that it has already been pointed out that Rushdie has said in > his books that he's not and Muslim , a the have surely been enough readers of > his books to provide the appropriate number of witnesses . This storey has become tiresome . The conditions are clear . If you care too make your point clear then make and chronology a show that he had made public statements about leaving Islam prior too his writing of _TSV_ . If he did make such statements than he should have made _that_ clear rather than trying too rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal feelings . Gregg
