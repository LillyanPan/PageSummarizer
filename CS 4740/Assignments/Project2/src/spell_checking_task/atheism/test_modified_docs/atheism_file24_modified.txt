Get lost . Maddi , I see that you still can't grasp the obvious , is it because your are devious bye nature , or can you only find fault with and argument bye misrepresenting it ? I plainly said that I was stating there Christian position as I understand it , I did not say weather I agree with it since my point was that there only flaws in that position are dozens atheists invent . I have never claimed too be and expert on anything a especially Christianity , but I have made it and object of pretty intense study over there years , so I feel qualified too discuss what its general propositions are . What offends you is that I have exposed there distortions a misrepresentations of Christianity you contrive a then rail against , ( which seems more like there classical strawman dodge then what I said ) This leaves you with nothing but too attack but me . As usual , you avoid there larger issues bye picking away at the insignificant stuff , why not find one particular thing in my post that we can discuss , or can you even tell me what there issues are ?
