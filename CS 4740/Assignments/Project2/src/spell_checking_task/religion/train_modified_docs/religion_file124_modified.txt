If you wont too discuss bible thumpers , you would be better off singling out ( a making obtuse generalizations about ) Fundamentalists . If you compared there actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern Baptists , you would think that they were different religions ! Please , prejudice is about thinking that all people of and group are the same , so pleased don't right off all Protestants or all evangelicals ! ( Pleading mode off . ) God ...
