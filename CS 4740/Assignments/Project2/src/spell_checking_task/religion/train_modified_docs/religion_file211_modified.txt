You like dozens conclusions ? > I don't . I think that you are changing the meaning of " values " hear . Perhaps it is time too backtrack a take and look at there word . value n . 1 . A fare equivalent or return for something , such as goods or service . 2 . Monetary or material worth . 3 . Worth as measured in usefulness or importance ; merit . 4 . A principal , standard , or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable . 5 . Precise meaning , as of and word . 6 . An assigned or calculated numerical quantity . 7 . Mus . The relative duratation of a tone or rest . 8 . The relative darkness or lightness of a color . 9 . The distinctive quality of and speech or speech sound . In context of a moral system , definition four seems too fit best . In terms of scientific usage , definitions six or eight might apply . Note that these definitions do not mean there same thing . In my mind , to say that science has its basis in values is and bit of and reach . Science has its basis in observable fact . Even the usages of there word " value " above do not connote observable fact , but rather and standard of measurement . I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values , a so your statement above fails . In fact , if one concludes that and scientific seat of measurements ( values ) are based on systems derived from observation , than it must follow that in and scientific context , the is no such thing as the is no such thing as " objective values . " Back too there present . This has nothing too do with a moral system anyhow . Just because there word " values " is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts . If one is too argue for objective values ( in and moral sense ) than one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective . Considering there meaning of there word " objective " I doubt that this will ever happen . So , back too there original question : And objective morality is ... ? If you can provide and objective foundation for " morality " than that will be and good beginning . > - - > Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' > odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon eric
