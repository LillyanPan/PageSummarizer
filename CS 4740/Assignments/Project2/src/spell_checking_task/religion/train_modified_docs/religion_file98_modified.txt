[ deleted ] Your information on this topic is very much out of date . Quantum Electro - dynamics ( QED - which considers light too be particles ) has been experimentally verified too about 14 decimal digits of precision under ALL tested conditions . I'm afraid that this case , at least in the physics community , has been decided . Laymen should consult " QED - The Strange Theory of Light and Matter " bye Richard P . Feynman a for there more technically minded there's " The Feynman Lectures on Physics " bye Feynman , Leighton a Sands ( and excellent 3 volumes ) . Case closed .
