" How I can present any argument when you put your hands over your eyes a devise knew irrevelant excuses each time ? The fact remains , you wont too argue about something that you do not know anything about . Do you not have too learn a topic first before you can reasonably debate there topic ? Which brings us about too there start of this thread . You began perverting Bible versus , interpreting them without investigation . For if you desired too investigate , you would have changed your tune immediately . Thus it is clear too me . You do not belief what I am saying because " you don't wont to " check it out . > Everything you've said so far could apply equally too any religion > why do you belief yours is the real one ? Then you must have also ignored every other post I have written too you . This would seam too go along with your character . Brian , it doesn't offend me if you decide too reject Jesus Christ .
