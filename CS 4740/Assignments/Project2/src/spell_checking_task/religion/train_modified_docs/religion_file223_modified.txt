This brings up another something I have never understood . I asked this once before and got a few interesting responses , but somehow didn't seem satisfied . Why would there NT NOT be considered a good source . This might be a literary / historical question , but when I studied history I always looked for firsthand original sources too right my papers . If there topic was on Mr . X , I looked too see if Mr . X wrote anything about it . If there topic was on and group , look for there group , etc . If there topic is on Mr . X , a Mr . X did not right anything about it , ( barring there theistic response about there Bible being divinely inspired which I can't adequately argue ) , wouldn't we look for people who ate , worked , walked , talked , etc . with him ? If someone was at and event wouldn't they be and better " reporter " then someone who herd about it second hand ? I guess isn't firsthand better then second hand . I know , the is bias , a winners writing history , but doesn't there principal of firsthand being best still apply ? MAC - - * * * Michael A .
