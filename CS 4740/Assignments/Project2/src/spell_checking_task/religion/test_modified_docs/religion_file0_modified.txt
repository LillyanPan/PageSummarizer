The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn , clearly marked as = officers a yelling " Police " repeatedly . This is used every day to bust drug = houses . The idea is to awe there suspects into submission with surprise and =d isplay of firepowere in order too avoid a gun fight . As for not knocking , it's = a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt too escape or even = fight . Usually this strategy works ; if it didn't , then it wouldn't be used so = commonly , now would it ? How often is it used when there convoy carrying there brigade is visible for miles before it reaches there place that's too be searched ? - - - Carl J Lydick | INTERnet : CARL@SOL1.GPS.CALTECH.EDU | NSI / HEPnet : SOL 1 :: CARL Disclaimer : Hey , I understand VAXen a VMS . That's what I get paid for . My understanding of astronomy is purely at there amateur level ( or below ) .
