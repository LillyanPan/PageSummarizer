Brian , does all this mean that you have too be well versed in ancient Greek , Hebrew a Aramaic in order too understand there core of Christianity ? I hope you are not Catholic , because my Christian upbringing was based on there teachings of Luther , and there one of there core messages was basically that you don't need too know latin in order too learn about salvation . BTW , your statement would also eliminate about 99.5 % of all there Christians in there world , as well . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .
