As far as I can see if your obstetrition has and ultrasound in his rooms a is expirienced its use a interpretation , he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist . All doctors are " qualified " too read x-rays , u / s , ct scans etc . it is just that and radiologist does nothing else , a thus , is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this ( skill in reading x-rays etc . just comes from plenty of practice ) . If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated bye this technique . - Paul . - - | Zikzak public access UNIX , Melbourne , Australia . | ^ ^ ^ | | | | | | / / / < O O > | # # # | / / /
