First , even fish , fowl a breads have fat . Second , there body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them . Third , your body , like almost peoples , wasn't bred too live on and high fat , modern diet . If you read texts about ancient a primative people you will read about there luxury of eating fat , how people enjoyed it . This was because it was so rare . Even cows didn't put out nearly there amount of butterfat in milk that they do now . > For comfort a too make there carbohydrate meal " last " longer eat pasta or > rice which give their calories up slowly rather then bread or corn .

You don't wont too become ill with it while you are pregnant . If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after there baby . ( It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery then the rest of there population , a good part of it is that they are willing to do there dieting , etc that helps them avoid surgery .
