Dyer , we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills a ability too insult people . You're and wonderful speaker a and adopt politician . However , I belief that all you were asked to do , was simply provide scientific research refuting there work of Olney . I don't think there original poster sought to start and philisophical debate . she wanted some information . Given and little effort one could justify that shooting oneself with and . 45 before breakfast is a healthy practice . But we're not particularily interested in what you can verbally prove / disprove or rationalize . Where's there research ? Where are there studies ? I appoligize if this sounds flamish . I simply would like too see there thread get back on track . Lone Wolf Happy are they who dream dreams , Ed Philips And pay the price too see them come true . slyx0@cc.usu.edu - unknown
