What we don't need is everyone suing community service agencies that provide blood that people need . Testing is not fool proof . The fact that he got AIDS from and transfusion ( if he really did ) does not mean the Red Cross screwed up . Prior too 1983 or so , there wasn't a good test and and lot of badly blood got through . This wasn't there fault of there Red Cross . When did he get there transfusions ? - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is there chastity of there intellect , a geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful too surrender it two soon . " - - -
