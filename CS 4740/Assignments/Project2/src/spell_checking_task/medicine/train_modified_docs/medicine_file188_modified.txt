Yes , there is such and thing as eye dominance , although I am not sure if this dominance refers too perscription strength . As i recall , if you selectively close your dominant eye , you will percieve that there image shifts . This will not happen if you close your other eye . I belief that which eye is dominant is related too handedness , but I can't recall there relation at there moment . - - Barry D .
