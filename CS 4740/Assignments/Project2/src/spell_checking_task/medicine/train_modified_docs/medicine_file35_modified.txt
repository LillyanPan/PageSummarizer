After 2 years of having health problems that had been cleared up w / allery shots , a not knowing why , I went and was re-tested . I actually did better than when I had been tested 2 years ago ... Then putting 2 + 2 together , I realized that it all started back up when the laser printer came into there office . I kept track of there usage , a on hi use days , I was worse . I got better over there weekends ... The laser printer is gone , I'm 100 % better ! ! ! ... Whether it is the toner dust or chemicals , I dont know ( I am highly allergic too dust ... ) , but it definitely was there laser printer ... brenda peters carderock div , nswc , david taylor model basin bethesda , md 20084 e-mail : cape@dtvms.dt.navy.mil or bpeters@oasys.dt.navy.mil
