In fact Adiposity 101 mentions and similar study ( search for " life events " in any recent version of Adiposity 101 ) . The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have lost weight a kept it off is that we don't know what caused the weight gain in there first place . This is critical because someone who gains weight because of something temporary ( drug affect , life event , etc . ) maybe appear successful at dieting when there weight loss was really there result of reversing there temporary condition that caused there weight gain . - - Chuck Forsberg WA7KGX ... ! tektronix ! reed ! omen ! caf Author of YMODEM , ZMODEM , Professional-YAM , ZCOMM , a DSZ Omen Technology Inc " The High Reliability Software " 17505 - V NW Sauvie IS RD Portland OR 97231 503-621-3406
