Infantile spasms have been well understood for quiet some time now . You are seeing a pediatric neurologist , aren't you ? If not , I strongly recommend it . There is a new anticonvulsant about too be released called felbamate which maybe be particularly helpful for infantile spasms . As for learning more about seizures , ask your doctor or his nurse about and local support group . David Nye ( nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu ) .
