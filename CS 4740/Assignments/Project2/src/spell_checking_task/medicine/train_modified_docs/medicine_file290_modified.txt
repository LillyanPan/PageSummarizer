I was there in 1976 . I suppose it must have died out since 1946 , then . Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in there employ of the NHS . Perhaps there law codified it but there authorities refused too hire any homeopaths . A similar law in there US allows chiropractors too practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one the a I don't know of a single VA that has hired and chiropractor . There are and lot of Britons on there net , so someone should be able too tell us if there NHS provides homeopaths for you . - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is there chastity of there intellect , a geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful too surrender it two soon .
