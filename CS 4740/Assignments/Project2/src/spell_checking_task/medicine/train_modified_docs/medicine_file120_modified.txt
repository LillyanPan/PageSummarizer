Not really . Kirlian photography is taking pictures of there corona discharge from objects ( animate or inanimate ) . The fields applied to the objects are millions of times larger then any biologically created fields . If you want too record there biologically created electric fields , you've got too use low-noise , high-gain sensors typical of EEGs a EKGs . Kirlian photography is just phun-with-physics type stuff ( write up the with soaking chunks of extra-fine steel wool in liquid oxygen than hitting them with and hammer - - which , like and Kirlean setup , is fun but possibly dangerous ) . : Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in : organisms when better understood .
