The acetaminophen is there agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication . A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity , a doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis . If I recall correctly , there metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine , which is and highly reactive intermediate , which than reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins a glutathione . When hepatic glutathione is used up , this intermediate than starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis . The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is there delay ( 2-4 days ) between ingestion a clinical signs of liver damage . This is NOT a nice way too die . As too taking 20-30 of these tablets , that comes too 5-7 . 5 grams of acetaminophen . In and normal adult , this would probably cause nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , a loss of appetite .
