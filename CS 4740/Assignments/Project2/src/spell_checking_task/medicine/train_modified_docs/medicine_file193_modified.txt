From : dwebb@unl.edu ( dale webb ) Subject : Re : THE BACK MACHINE - Update I have and BACK MACHINE a have had one since January . While I have not founded it too be and panacea for my back pain , I think it has helped somewhat . It MAINLY acts too stretch muscles in there back a prevent spasms associated with pain . I am taking less pain medication then I was previously . The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant too honor their return policy . They extended my " warranty " period rather then allow me too return there machine when , after there first month or so , I was not thrilled with it . They encouraged me to continue too use it , abeit less vigourously . Like I said , I can't say it is and cure-all , but it keeps me stretched out a I am in less pain . - - * * * Dale M .
