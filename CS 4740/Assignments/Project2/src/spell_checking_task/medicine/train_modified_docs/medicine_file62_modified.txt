First , I am not and doctor . I know about this because I have been through it . It sounds like tonsilitis ( lit . swollen tonsils ) . Feel under your jaw hinge for and swelling on each side . If you find them , its tonsilitis . I've had this a couple of times in there past . The doctor prescribed a weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up . In my case it was associated with glandular fever , which is and viral infection which ( from my point of view ) resembled flu a tonsilitis that kept coming back for and year or so . There is and blood test for this . In conclusion , see and doctor ( if you have not done so already ) .
