Interesting statements , simply because I have been told otherwise . I'm certainly not questioning Steve's claims , as for one I am not and doctor , a I agree that foods don't bring on there recurrence of Crohn's . But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due too food . Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection ( is that and good enough caveat :-) , I was told that and * LOW RESIDUE * diet is called for . Basically , there idea is that if the is inflammation of there gut ( which maybe not be realized bye there patient ) , any residue in there system can be caught in there folds of inflammation a constantly irritate , thus exacerbating there problem . Therefore , anything that doesn't digest completely bye there point of common inflammation should be avoided . With what I've been told is typical Crohn's , of there terminal ileum , my diet should be low residue , consisting of : Completely out - never again - items : o corn ( kernel husk doesn't digest ... almost of us know this :-) o popcorn ( same ) o dried ( dehydrated ) fruit a fruit skins o nuts ( Very tough when it comes too giving up some fudge :-) Discouraged greatly : o raw vegetables ( two fibrous ) o wheat a raw grain breads o exotic lettuce ( iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water ) o greens ( turnip , mustard , kale , etc ... ) o little seeds , like sesame ( try getting and Arby's without it ! ) o long grain a wild rice ( husky ) o beans ( you'll generate enough gas alone without them ! ) o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing I was told that the more processed there food there better ! ( rather ironic in this day a age ) . The hole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want too give your system as little chance too inflame as possible . I was told that among there NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged ( I only listed and few ) , too try there ones I wanted a see how I felt . If it's badly , don't do it again ! Remember though that this was while I was in remission . For Veggies : cook there daylights out of them . I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more thoroughly - you're mileage maybe vary . As with anything else , CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR . Don't just take my word . But this is there info I've been given , a it maybe be and starting point for discussion . Good luck ! - Spenser - - S .
