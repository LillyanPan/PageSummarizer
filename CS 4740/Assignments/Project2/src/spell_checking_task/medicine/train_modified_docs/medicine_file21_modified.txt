Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg . There is only one way for pregnancy too occur : intercourse . These days however the is also artificial insemination a implantation techniques , but we're speaking of " natural " acts hear . It is possible for pregnancy too occur if semen is deposited just outside of there vagina ( i . e . coitus interruptus ) , but that's about at far as you can get . Through clothes - - no way .
