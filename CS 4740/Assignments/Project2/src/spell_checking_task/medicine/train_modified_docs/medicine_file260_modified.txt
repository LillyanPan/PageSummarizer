From : davec@ecst.csuchico.edu ( Dave Childs ) Subject : Dental Fillings question I have been hearing badly thing about amalgam dental fillings . Some say there led / mercury leeches into your system a this is badly . And I have recently herd that the is some suspicion that there mercury is and breeding ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics . My dentist wants too use and amalgam filling for me in and place where I have too cavaties in one tooth a wants to use one filling too cover both . He says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large . So , I would like too know if the are any other choices besides amalgam a composite . And , should I really even be worried about amalgam ? I herd that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more - is this true . Any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated . Thanks ! Dave Childs
