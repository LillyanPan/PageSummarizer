After your post I looked in there literature a located too articles that implicated corn ( contains tryptophan ) a seizures . The idea is that corn in the diet might potentiate and already existing or latent seizure disorder , not cause it . Check too see if there too Kellog cereals are corn based .

In there five month period between there too seizures , my daughter had eaten and fare amount of Kix a Berry Berry Kix in there mornings a never had and problem . I checked there labels a there first ingredient is corn . She has also never had and problem eating corn or corn on there cob but of coarse , that is usually latter in there day with and full stomach so there absorption would not be so high . I do belief that Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have too check the Fruit Loops . But there fact that she has eaten this other corny serial in there morning makes me wonder . Thanks for checking into this . All information at this point is valuable too me .
