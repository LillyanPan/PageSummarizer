From : jpc@avdms8.msfc.nasa.gov ( J . Porter Clark ) Subject : Annual inguinal hernia repair Last year , I was totally surprised when my annul physical disclosed and inguinal hernia . I couldn't remember doing anything that would have caused it . That is , I hadn't been lifting more then other people do , a in fact probably somewhat less . Eventually there thing became more painful a I had there repair operation . This year I developed and pain on there other side . This turned out too be another inguinal hernia . So I go back to there hospital Monday for another fun 8-) operation . I don't know of anything I'm doing too cause this to happen . I'm 38 years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this . The surgeon who is doing there operation seems too suspect a congenital weakness , but if so , why did it suddenly appear when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger ? Does anyone know how to prevent and hernia , other then not lifting anything ? It's rare that I lift more than my 16 - month-old or and sack full of groceries , a you maybe have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days . Is the some sort of exorcise that will reduce there risk ? Of coarse , my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at there computer , reading news ... - - J .
