Actually , sever headaches due too stopped up sinuses ( plugged ostia ) are possible , a sinus surgery which widens there ostia - from there normal 2 mm too about 10 mm - should relieve this . There are non-surgical ways , however , to keep there ostia open ( however , in and few individuals , their ostia are naturally very small ) , and Dr . Ivker's book talks about this . The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery , though . About asthma , that's and little more controversial . Dr . Ivker , in his book , " Sinus Survival " , * speculates * ( a says it's not proven ) , that many cases of asthma are triggered bye chronic sinusitis due to there excessive drainage ( postnasal drip ) from the sinuses . He's had many patience who've founded relief from asthma when there chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof , but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation . Before doing any sinus surgery , first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery , as well as and good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis .
