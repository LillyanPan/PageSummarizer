I find this pretty hard too belief ; has anyone else herd it ? MSG is mono sodium glutamate , and fairly straight foreword compound . If it is pure , there source should not be and problem .

The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in there first instance followed by there arms then the legs , headache , lethargy a unable too keep awake . I think it maybe well affect people differently .
