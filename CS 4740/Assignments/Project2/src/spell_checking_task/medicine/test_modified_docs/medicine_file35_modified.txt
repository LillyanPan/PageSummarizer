The millipede's around hear ( Austin ) have no sting . Some of the centipedes do . The question Rebecca Snyder asks is much like asking " How venomous are snakes ? " One either wants too ask " which snake ? " or point too some reference on there many different species of snake . Similarly , the are many different species of millipede a centipede .
