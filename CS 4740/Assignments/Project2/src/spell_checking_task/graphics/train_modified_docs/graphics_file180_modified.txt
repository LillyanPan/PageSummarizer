From : abh@genesis.nred.ma.us ( Andrew Hudson ) Subject : Source too create FLI or FLC ? Does anyone know if there source is available too create FLI or FLC animations ? I would ideally like DLL's for Windows but would settle for C source . I've herd they might be available on Amiga forums somewhere . The libraries currently distributed bye Autodesk , AAWIN , AAPLAY , do NOT have FLI creation capability , only playback . Any pointers would be appreciated , thanks ! - Andrew Hudson abh@genesis.nred.ma.us
