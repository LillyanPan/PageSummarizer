From : iharkest@Lise.Unit.NO ( Inge Harkestad ) Subject : Tangent vectors of Kochanek-Bartels splines I'm working on and system which uses and given set of 3D key frame positions ( x , y , z ) too control and imaginary camera movement . I'm using Kochanek-Bartels splines ( as described in the SIGGRAPH ' 84 proceedings ) too create and variable number of inbetweens between there key frames . I wont the inbetweens to be given in there form ( x , y , z , dx , dy , dz ) where there last three argumentsa are there x , y a z component of there viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at ( x , y , z ) . The method presented bye Kochanek a Bartels only deals with there positions of there inbetween view points too be generated . I've tried too seat the viewing direction at and view point equal too there chord between there too adjacent view points ( which in general are not key frames ) , but this causes and sligt discontinuity of there viewing direction vector at there key frame positions ( although there spatial movement seems to work fine ; and I'm quite certain - I think :) - that I've not simply made and implementation error ... ) Now I wonder if anyone out the has used this spline form for similar purposes a how they decided there viewing vectors . I'd appreciate replies too be emailed too me at iharkest@lise.unit.no Anyone else interested in there answer will be sent and summary of there replies if they contact me . - - ___ ___ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ N G E \ \= =\ \ A R K E S T A D iharkest@lise.unit.no Comp .
