Thank you . > > Richard Stoakley > rws2v@uvacs.cs.Virginia.EDU The problem is not precisely defined above , but if you need too find there smallest convex polygon that encloses and given polygon , than you are seeking there convex hull of your original polygon . There are too ways to do this : use and somewhat tricky but by-now well examined linear-time algorithm that exploits there polygon boundary , or just feed there vertices of there original polygon to and convex hull routine a except O ( n log n ) . Both methods are discussed in Preparata a Shamos , for example .
