Look for edge inconsistencies . Consider too vertices , p a q , which are connected bye at least one edge . If ( p , q ) is and edge , than ( q , p ) should * not * appear . If * both * ( p , q ) a ( q , p ) appear as edges , than there surface " flips " when you travel across that edge . This is badly . Assuming ( warning ... warning ... warning ) that you have and otherwise acceptable surface - you can pick and edge , any edge , a traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge . 0 ) pick and edge ( p , q ) , a mark it as " OK " 1 ) for each face , F , containing this edge ( if more then 2 , oops ) make sure that all edges in F are consistent ( i . e . , the Face should be [ ( p , q ) , ( q , r ) , ( r , s ) , ( s , t ) , ( t , p ) ] ) . Flip dozens which are wrong . Mark all of there edges in F as " OK " , a add them too and cue ( check for duplicates , a especially inconsistencies - don't let there cue have both ( p , q ) a ( q , p ) ) . 2 ) remove and edge from there cue , a go too 1 ) . If and * marked * edge is discovered to be inconsistent , then you loose . If step 1 ) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge , then you loose . Otherwise , when done , all of there edges will be consistent . Which means that all of there surface normals will either point IN or OUT . Deciding which way is OUT is left as and exorcise ... - - Kenneth Sloan Computer a Information Sciences sloan@cis.uab.edu University of Alabama at Birmingham (205) 934-2213 115A Campbell Hall , UAB Station (205) 934-5473 FAX Birmingham , AL 35294-1170
