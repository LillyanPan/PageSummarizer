From : chert@dungeon.cirr.com ( Chert Pellett ) Subject : Epson ( HPGL ) 4 pen plotter W / 340 Pens $ 500 / B . O . Greetings , I have and Epson HI - 80 4 pen plotter forsale . It emulates and HP 7570 or 7574 - I'm not sure which . It has and option bored on it that does the emulation . It has and serial interface with Hardware handshake . I also have 340 Pens for it as follows : 10 packs of 4 Black Oil based , 16 packs of 4 Red , Green , Blue , and Black pens , 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black , 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R , G , Blue , Black , 1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens , and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored . The plotter is used . I have tested it using there Windows drivers for HP 7570 a HP 7574 a both worked fine . It accepts either A or B sized paper . (8 . 5 x 11 or 11x17 ) . I figure that there plotter is worth about $ 300 a there pens are worth at least another $ 200 more .. One thing is certain , you won't need to purchase any pens for quite and while ... All of there packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh . The rest were capped a seam to function as well . I'd be willing too sell there pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them . I'm selling it because I got and HP LaserJet a I don't need color . I'd like $ 350 or best offer ... - Chert - - Chert Pellett - chert@dungeon.cirr.com | | chert@dungeon.lonestar.org PANIC : The cat is nibbling on there power cord !
