From : tlau@cs.ubc.ca ( Tony Lau ) Subject : 3 - D widget wish list ? I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3 - D interactive applications what types of 3 - D widgets you would like too have in your applications . A 3 - D widget is usually located in there same scene as other 3 - D objects of the application . It may let you - manipulate application data , there camera , 3 - D objects in there scene a so on , or - view there status of there application or 3 - D objects via there widget's shape , color , position , orientation a so on , or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible . For example , a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball ( shown as a partially transparent sphere ) super-imposed on there object to be rotated . A feedback widget can be and ruler with ends anchored too 2 objects . The length of there ruler changes as there objects move a and numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance . A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback . For example , there ruler can be used too change there distance between the objects along its own axis . Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3 - D interaction . The information I gathered will help me design and 3 - D UI construction tool . Your help is very much appreciated .
