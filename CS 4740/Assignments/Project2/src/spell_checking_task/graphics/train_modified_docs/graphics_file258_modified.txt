It's supposedly and high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics accelerators . It's quiet fast ( I have 7 ) , but as usual with knew boards / chips there drivers are buggy for Windows . As far as Winmarks go , it depends upon there version . I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11 . 2.5 yielded there 50 + number . I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 ( from memory as well ) . As far as there low-level stuff goes , it looks pretty nice . It's got this quadrilateral fill command that requires just there four points . It's very fast , but beware of buggy drivers , a otherwise no non-windows support . - - I am not responsible for anything I do or say - - I'm just and opinion . Robert J . C . Kyanko ( rob@rjck.UUCP )
