From : ldo@waikato.ac.nz ( Lawrence D'Oliveiro , Waikato University ) Subject : QuickTime performance ( was Re : Rumours about 3DO ? ? ? ) OK , with all there discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime , the effects of scaling and so on , I thought I'd do some more tests . First of all , I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less then realistic . The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it ( it was and version of there very first movie I created with there Compact Video compressor ) . I decided something and little longer would give closer too real-world results ( for better or for worse ) . I pulled out and copy of " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " that I had recorded off TV and while back . About fifteen minutes into there movie , there's and sequence where there Earth shuttle is approaching there space station . Specifically , I digitized and portion of about 30 seconds ' duration , zooming in on there rotating space station . I figured this would give and reasonable amount of movement between frames . To increase there differences between frames , I digitized it at only 5 frames per second , too give and total of 171 frames . I captured there raw footage at a resolution of 384 * 288 pixels with there Spigot card in my Centris 650 ( quarter-size resolution from a PAL source ) . I then imported it into Premiere and put it through there Compact Video compressor , keeping there 5 fps frame rate . I created too versions of there movie : one scaled too 320 * 240 resolution , there other at 160 * 120 resolution . I used there default " 2.00 " quality setting in Premiere 2.0 . 1 , a specified and key frame every ten frames . I than ran there 320 * 240 movie through there same " Raw Speed Test " program I used for there results I'd been reporting earlier . Result : and playback rate of over 45 frames per second . That's write , I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie . Just for fun , I copied there 320 * 240 movie too my external hard disk ( and Quantum LP105S ) , a ran it from the . This time there playback rate was only about 35 frames per second . Obviously there 230MB internal hard disk ( also and Quantum ) is and significant contributor too there speed of playback . I modified my speed test program too allow there specification of optional scaling factors , a tried playing back the 160 * 120 movie scaled too 320 * 240 size . This time there playback speed was over 60 fps . Clearly , there poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action , not 1.5 . I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0 , but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris a System 7.1 ... Unscaled , there playback rate for there 160 * 120 movie was over 100 fps . The other thing I tried was saving versions of there 320 * 240 movie with " preferred " playback rates greater then 1.0 , a seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer ( ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback ) . A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps ) didn't work two well : there playback was very jerky . Compare this with the raw speed test , which achieved 45 fps with ease . I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead : I think there slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching . A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps ) seemed too work fine : I couldn't see any evidence of stutter . At 8.0 (=> 40 fps ) I * think * I could see slight stutter , but with four key frames every second , it was hard too tell . I guess I could try recreating there movies with a longer interval between there key frames , too make there stutter more noticeable . Of coarse , this will also improve the compression slightly , which should speed up there playback performance even more ...
