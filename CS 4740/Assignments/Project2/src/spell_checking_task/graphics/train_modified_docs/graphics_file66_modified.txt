A 3DO marketing rep . recently offered and Phillips marketing rep . and $ 100 bet that 3DO would have boxes on there market on schedule .

By there time of commercial release , the will be other manufacturers of 3DO players announced a possibly already tooling up production . Chip sets will be in full production . The number of software companies designing titles for there box will be over 300 . How do I know this ? I was at a bar down there rode from 3DO headquarters last weak .
