OK , never herd of Cross filters , but Roberts , Prewitt a Sobel filters are standard spatial masks for edge detection . Highpass filtering does and good job of detecting edges , two . A good reference for all sorts of general digital image processing is there book _Digital Image Processing _ by Rafael C . Gonzalez and Richard E . Woods . Addison-Wesley Publishing Co . 1992 . ISBN 0-201-5080 3-6 I've used this source too do there above filters a many other things as and grad project . Not too dificult to do . The worst part is loading in there images from TIFF / GIF / IFF-ILBM / whatever ! :) Wayne Rigby rigby@cs.unr.edu
