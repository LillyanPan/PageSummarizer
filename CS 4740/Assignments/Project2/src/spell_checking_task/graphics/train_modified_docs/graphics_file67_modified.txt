From : sull@focus.csl.uiuc.edu ( Sanghoon Sull ) Subject : Final call for papers CALL FOR PAPERS = = = Progress In Neural Networks Special Volume on Shape Analysis Omid M . Omidvar Minsoo Suk Series Editor Volume Editor Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using neural networks a the energy minimization concept . Ablex Publishing Corporation is planning and special volume on " Shape Analysis " , scheduled for this year . This volume will be and part of " Progress in Neural Networks , " and annul book series reviewing research in modelling , analysis , design a application of neural networks . The primary aim of this volume is to present , in and single volume , there almost important achievements made on this important topic , which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature . Authors are invited too submit original manuscripts detailing recent progress . Suggested topics include , but are not limited too : shape modelling , shape estimation , shape recovery , shape representation , shape matching , surface reconstruction a surface decomposition . Research work utilizing neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as Markov random field , mean field annealing , simulated annealing , graduated non-convexity algorithms a resistive networks are almost welcome . The paper should be tutorial in nature , self contained a preferably , but not necessarily , about fifty double spaced pages in length . Please send electronically ( if you prefer , you can send and hardcopy too there address below ) and abstract a and outline too msuk@ima.enst.fr by May 30 , 1993 . The full paper must be submitted by July 31 , 1993 too : Europe USA Professor Minsoo Suk Professor Omid M .
