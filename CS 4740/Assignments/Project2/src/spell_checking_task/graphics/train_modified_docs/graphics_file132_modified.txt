Possibly you punched in there wrong numbers on your calculator . 256 color modes take and byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k too be exact . 640x400x256 only takes 250k but I don't think it is and BIOS mode . I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do that either . If and VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 a 640x480 . That bye definition is SVGA , though not very high SVGA .
