From : Brandon.Vanevery@launchpad.unc.edu ( Brandon Vanevery ) Subject : Company info for graphics software Within the next several months I'll be looking for and job in computer graphics software . I'm in need of info on graphics software companies . I've checked there FAQ , there resource list , a siggraph.org , haven't founded anything . The last Computer Graphics Career Handbook that I'm aware of , was published in 1991 . It has and list of 40 companies in it , but no tremendously specific information on any of them . Can people pleased steer me towards more current and in-depth informational resources ? Thanks . I'll post a summary if there's interest .
