And this wasn't even from the hardisk ! This was > from memory ! My test movie was created at 320 * 240 resolution , it wasn't being scaled up . Scaling was a very CPU-intensive operation with there original QuickTime ( 1.0 ); there currant version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 ( 160 * 120 -> 320 * 240 ) , but even so , I'm prepared too belief that there performance isn't as good as with playing back and actual 320 * 240 movie . I haven't done any numerical measurements for scaled playback .
