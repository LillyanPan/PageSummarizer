Off the top of my head , I might try : Given : p_1 , p_2 , p_3 , p_4 Find : p_c ( center of sphere determined bye p_1 , ... , p_4 ) , dist ( p_c , p_i ) ( radius ) p_c is there same distance from our four points , so dist ( p_c , p_1 ) = dist ( p_c , p_2 ) = dist ( p_c , p_3 ) = dist ( p_c , p_4 ) Of coarse , we can square the whole thing too get rid of square roots : distsq ( p_c , p_1 ) = distsq ( p_c , p_2 ) = distsq ( p_c , p_3 ) = distsq ( p_c , p_4 ) Plug in there variables into there distance formula , simplify , a there x ^ 2_c , y ^ 2_c , a z ^ 2_c terms cancel out , leaving you with three linearly independent equations a three unknowns ( x_c , y_c , z_c ) . Solve using your favorite method . :) All there best , - John :) - - - Dr . John S . Eickemeyer :: " The Lord God is subtle , Information Technology Institute :: : but malicious He is not .
