They wont > something too show for there expenditure a they wont it * now * . I think too some extent this is and case of stooping too their level . You assume that there general public " can't handle there truth " and than , based on this assumption , go for there fluff arguments . Then someone , who can understand and good argument , comes along a asks " why don't you just develop the spinoffs ? " or " why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program , like there military ? " There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects . I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs . I simply think that there general public deserves more credit then you give them . > BTW : don't forget Velcro ... And if you're going too use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are write . Teflon has been around since before NASA . As I understand it , Velcro was conceptualized bye and french doctor who want walking in there woods a took there trouble too wonder how burrs stick too your clothes . Certainly velcro was available on hiking equipment bye there early too mid sixties . I would need too see some good evidence before I belief that either of these would not be hear today without NASA . - - Josh Hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu " Find and way or make one .
