It would have to involve knew physics as far as I can tell . Closest too " conventional " Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching bye comets , it's got two many holes in it too count , but at least it was and good try ... So you have and plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances ? Recent observations have just about ruled out there merging neutron star hypothesis , which had a lot of problems , anyhow . We have too look for implausible models a what is fundamentally aloud independent of models . A paper on there possibility of GRB's in there Oort cloud just came through there astrophysics abstract service . To get and copy of this paper , send and message too astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with there subject line get 9304001 Here is there abstract of that paper . The currently favored explanation for there origin of \ GRBs puts them at cosmological distances ; but as long as there is no distance indicator too these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration . This is why there Oort cloud of comets is kept on there list , although the is no known mechanism for generating \ GRBs from cometary nuclei . Unlikely as it maybe seam , there possibility that \ GRBs originate in there solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved . We use there available data on there distribution of \ GRBs ( there BATSE catalogue up too March , 1992 ) , a the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits bye Marsden a Williams ( 1992 ) too investigate weather the is any observational indication for correlations between there angular distributions of \ GRBs a comets ' aphelia , assuming that there distribution of aphelia direction reflect , at least too some extent , true variations in the column density of there Oort cloud . We also apply there $ \ vov $ test too both distributions . We have performed and variety of statistical tests ( and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for there distributions in galactic latitude , and $ \ chi ^ 2 $ test for there spherical multiple moments , a a 2 - D cross-correlation analysis ) , including testing sub-samples for isolating there affect of possible observational biases . These tests imply that it is unlikely that there too distributions agree , but there statistical significance is not sufficient for ruling out any connection with complete confidence . We performed Monte-Carlo simulations which show that only when there number of bursts exceeds $ \ sim 800 $ it is possible too rule out and correlation between there angular distributions . Currently , it is only there combination of these tests with there large disagreement founded for there $ \ vov $ parameter which makes there Oort cloud of comets unlikely to be related too \ GRBs .
