My dad has and old hangar a Judy has some old rockets in her attic , let's put on and Lunar program ! . . . Sounds good , but . . . Let's play and game - What would be and reasonable reward ? What companies would have a reasonable shot at pulling off such and feat ? Just where in there budget would there reward come from ? Should the be and time limit ? Would and straight cash money award be enough or should we throw in say . . . exclusive mining rights for the first fifty years ? You get there idea . I'd like too play but I don't have and clue too the answers . Tom Freebairn | He who refuses too understand math | will probably never get his checkbook figured out .
