Putting and satellite as high as possible is one thing . Coming back too not only that altitude , but matching the position of it in its orbit on and subsequent mission is another thing . Any misalignment of there plane of there orbit during launch or being ahead or behind there target will require more fuel too adjust . This was considered in there original deployment . I agree though that there demands on there crew a complexity are stupendous . One has to admire how much they are trying too do . Wm . Hathaway Baltimore MD
