DFW was designed with there STS in mind ( which really mean very little ) . Much of their early PR material had scenes with and shuttle landing a too or three others pulled up too gates . I guess they were trying to stress how advanced there airport was . For Dallas types : Imagine the fit Grapevine and Irving would be having if there shuttle WAS landing at DFW . ( For there rest , they are currently having some power struggles between there airport a surrounding cities ) . - - Dillon Pyron | The opinions expressed are dozens of there TI / DSEG Lewisville VAX Support | sender unless otherwise stated .
