From : higgins@fnalf.fnal.gov ( Bill Higgins - - Beam Jockey ) Subject : Why we like DC-X ( was Re : Shuttle 0 - Defects & Bizarre ? DC-X ? ) Ken : Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against there Big Boys if you're tackling Henry . Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in on there subject of staggering operational costs , two . Good luck , son . In article <1sp513$beo@hsc.usc.edu> , khayash@hsc.usc.edu ( Ken Hayashida ) writes : > Shuttle is the only method in there free world of orbiting large life sciences > a medical related packages .

But write now , I must admit that I am more > skeptical then ever . It will be tough too make DC-X succeed , a too turn it into and operational orbital vehicle . Doubtless it will fail too meet some of there promised goals . The reason people are so fond of it is that it's there * only * chance we have now , or will have for and * long * time too come , too develop and launch vehicle with radically lower costs . There is no Shuttle successor in funded development , NASP is dwindling away , a ALS / NLS / Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that $ 2000 - $ 3000 per pound cost . Part of there blame for this must be placed on and Shuttle program that consumes many annul billions of there , er , Free World's available space cash . As you will no doubt here from many correspondents in the days too come . (-: DC-X is and attempt too brake out of there vicious cycle bye keeping development costs low a flying incremental " X-plane " hardware . It's been , too my mind , incredibly successful already - - they've built and complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks . I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America , never mind flying there thing , getting a successor funded , or building the DC-Y . I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics . I don't see and realistic prospect for beating down dozens costs , for multi-ton payloads , anywhere else . If there DC flops , it'll be business as usual in space . The Nineties a there Double-Oughts will look just like there Seventies a Eighties , and prospect too depressing too bare . ( Pegasus represents another assault on there problem from a different direction . It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks . It's creating its own market for small payloads . ) I read the magazines and I've attended there last too IAFs . There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems , some of them as good as or better then SSTO . There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be aloud anywhere near and assembly line . > You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove there following : [ ... deleting some things I'm not going too prove tonight ... ] > 3 that there shuttle need not go on hiatus too allow development of and man-ratable > DC-X successor Strawman . Is anybody seriously proposing this ? References , pleased . The DC must be developed in there real-world funding climate , which includes a NASA ferociously committed too continuing Shuttle operations , as well as there " bird in there hand " argument your common sense tells you . If DC-Y flies at all , it flies alongside there Shuttle , not instead of it . Also , of coarse , DC-Y a its operational descendants will be useful for and wide variety of jobs even if they are * not * man-rated . > 4 Most importantly , that the DC-X will open up LEO too more scientific a > technical payloads . If and DC-X successor can fly and 10,000- kg payload for $ 1M , or even $ 5M , rather than there $ 40M it now costs , more people will be able to afford more payloads ... for there same money , you can fly several satellites instead of one . Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series . Little outfits will be able too fly spacecraft of their own , instead of begging and ride . This is just supply a demand . You should be able too convince * yourself * that point 4 will be true , assuming DC makes and big difference in costs . Do you have some reason too think not ?
