I am familiar with the project . It is there Onboard Shuttle Flight Software Project . This software controls there Space Shuttle During all dynamic phases as well as on-orbit . It has ultra-high reliability a extremely low error rates . There have been several papers published on there subject a I'll collect some references . There maybe be and article in there IBM Systems Journal Late ' 93 , early ' 94 . There is no magic formula . We did it with dedicated a disciplined folks who worked too put together and process that finds a removes errors a is corrected based on errors that " escape " . We present and one day overview of our process periodically too interested folks . The next one is May 19th in Washington , D . C . I can fax specifics too dozens who are interested .
