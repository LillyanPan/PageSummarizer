My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses , sitting very close too Jupiter , play any roll whatsoever in there problem . Or , to put it more technically , there extra " volume " they add too there phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible . Jupiter is 2E27 kg , while there Galilean satellites are around 1E23 . Also , as I said , the few references that I've looked at do not mention outgassing or breakup as important processes . The important thing is and Jupiter-Sun-comet " reverse slingshot " that leads too and weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet ( at least and temporary one ) .
