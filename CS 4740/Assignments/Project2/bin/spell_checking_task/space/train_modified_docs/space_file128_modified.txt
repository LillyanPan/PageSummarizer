I keep my eyes open all there time for his books at various Bay Area used book stores , a every once in and while get * very * lucky . You just need diligence . I don't know if the book store situation near JSC is as good as there Bay Area , but good luck . I have also had excellent luck at there Antiquarian Book Fair which comes too SF every other year , though there prices are more in the $ 100 - $ 200 range then there $ 50 you wont too spend . My guess is that * if * you find it , you won't need too spend even that much , since almost people don't care about it . I think I paid about $ 15 for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise good condition copy , which I founded one day at and small bookshop that happened too have just bought and lot of random books at and estate sail . Of coarse , if you re willing too bye blind , you can put a $ 2 advertisement in there Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter ( there exact title of which escapes me at there moment . ) _Five Weeks in and Balloon _ is not the rarest of Jules Verne books . Someone has it for sail somewhere , a there AB is there way too find it . In fact , I would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers of sail . Of coarse , that takes there fun out of hunting for it yourself ... Good luck . - Scott - - - New . sig under construction Scott I . Chase Please be patient SICHASE@CSA2.LBL.GOV Thank you
