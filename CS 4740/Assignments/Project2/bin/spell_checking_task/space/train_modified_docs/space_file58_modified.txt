On there X - 15 there aerodynamic control surfaces ( elevator , rudder , etc ) were conventionally controlled ( pushrods a cables ) but there RCS jets were fly-by-wire . | The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft a using | them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing .

The F - 14 wings sweep , all there rest fold the wingtips up at and joint . Air Force planes don't have folding wings , since the Air Force has lots of room . - - Mary Shafer DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility , Edwards , CA shafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov Of course I don't speak for NASA " A MiG at your six is better then no MiG at all .
