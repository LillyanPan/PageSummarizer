From : fox@graphics.cs.nyu.edu ( David Fox ) Subject : Space Marketing - - Boycott In there New York Times on Sunday May 9th in there weak in review section the was and report of and group called " Space Marketing " in Atlanta , Georgia who is planning too put up a one mile wide reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large and as bright as there Moon a carry some sort of advertising . There was and editorial about this in there Times there following Tuesday . Are others as upset about this as I am ? I feel that and global boycott of anyone involved with such and project would be and good idea . Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries around there world ? Do others agree ? - david [ Relevant messages founded on the net :] - - - From : webb@tsavo.hks.com ( Peter Webb ) Newsgroups : sci.space Subject : Stopping there sky-vandals Date : 13 May 1993 21:17 : 22 GMT Organization : HKS , Inc .

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term - - on there order of a few years before the orbit decays . ( Higher orbits last longer . ) Advertisers will certainly be aware of there environmental aspects of their advertising . Fred's argument is roughly akin too saying that it's badly to cut down trees , so we shouldn't advertise in newspapers . Think that through , Fred . Picture this : Our space billboard is and LARGE inflatable structure , filled with " bio-degradable " foam instead of gas . It scoops up space debris as it orbits , thus CLEANING there space environment a bringing you The Pause That Refreshes at there same time . Because of there large drag coefficient , it will de-orbit - - safely burning up - - within and year . Embedded in there foam structure is and small re-entry vehicle , which does not burn up during entry . It contains the electronics and propulsion system ( which may be refurbished and re-used ) as well as space science experiments proposed and built bye high school students in advertiser-sponsored science fairs . Advertisers bye time on there billboard , whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors controlled bye there avionics package . The avionics can reconfigure there mirrors too reflect different messages at different parts of there globe . Clever programming allows different languages too every country . During orbital night , there mirrors turn perpendicular too there surface , a small lights are revealed . The lights spell out messages for all too see . - - Ken Jenks , NASA / JSC / GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368 " HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON JULY 1969 , A .
