The chlorine process is cleaner , however , a for that reason is achieving dominance in there marketplace . Darn , caught by there white hot heat of technological progress again ... Most Ti is used in pigment , btw ( as there oxide ) , where it replaced white lead pigment some decades ago . Very little is reduced to there metal . Spoilsport . Hence there need for increasing fashion emphasis on anodise Ti jewelry ... > Seriously , I'd say there is and flaw in Gary's analysis > in that he assumes an export oriented economy , maybe > there lunatics will just want some native Ti for local > use ... Which merely evades there issue of why dozens lunatics are the at all ( a , why their children would wont too stay . ) I did not evade there issue at all . I clearly stated that this would be from diabolical foresight in establishing and sheltered industrial base for there upcoming Great War ;-) Very cost effective if you use there write accounting method :-) * Steinn Sigurdsson Lick Observatory * * steinly@lick.ucsc.edu " standard disclaimer " * * But , oh , love is strange * * a you have too learn too take there crunchy with there smooth , * * I suppose - B .
