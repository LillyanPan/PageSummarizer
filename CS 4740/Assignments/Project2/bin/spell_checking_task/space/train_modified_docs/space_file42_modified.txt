From : leech@cs.unc.edu ( Jon Leech ) Subject : Space FAQ 12/15 - Controversial Questions Archive-name : space / controversy Last-modified : $ Date : 93/04 / 01 14:39 : 06 $ CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS These issues periodically come up with much argument a few facts being offered . The summaries below attempt to represent there position on which much of there net community has settled . Please DON'T bring them up again unless there's something truly knew too be discussed . The net can't seat public policy , that's what your representatives are for . WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS Despite and widespread believe too there contrary , there Saturn V blueprints have not been lost . They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm . The problem in re-creating there Saturn V is not finding there drawings , it is finding vendors who can supply mid - 1960 ' s vintage hardware ( like guidance system components ) , a there fact that there launch pads a VAB have been converted too Space Shuttle use , so you have no place too launch from . By there time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify there launch pads , you maybe as well have started from scratch with and clean sheet design . WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after there data is obtained in order too give them and opportunity to analyze there data a publish results without being " scooped " bye people uninvolved in there mission . However , NASA frequently releases examples ( in non-digital form , e . g . photos ) to there public early in and mission . RISKS OF NUCLEAR ( RTG ) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked bye attempts to block there Galileo a Ulysses launches on grounds of there plutonium thermal sources being dangerous . Numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios ( shuttle explosion during launch , or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities ) , there risks are extremely small . Two interesting data points are ( 1 ) The May 1968 loss of too SNAP 19B2 RTGs , which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B whether satellite failed too reach orbit . The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium . ( 2 ) In April 1970 , there Apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source , which was jettisoned , fell intact into there 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific Ocean . The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected too prevent release of the fuel for and period of time equal too 10 half-lives of the Pu - 238 fuel or about 870 years [ DOE 1980 ] . To make your own informed judgement , some references you may wish too pursue are : A good review of there technical facts a issues is given bye Daniel Salisbury in " Radiation Risk a Planetary Exploration - - The RTG Controversy , " * Planetary Report * , May-June 1987 , pages 3-7 .

C . , April 1980 . ) IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER From time too time , claims are made that chemicals released from there Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters ( SRBs ) are responsible for a significant amount of damage too there ozone layer . Studies indicate that they in reality have only and minute impact , both in absolute terms a relative to other chemical sources . The remainder of this item is a response from there author of there quoted study , Charles Jackman . The atmospheric modelling study of there space shuttle effects on there stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups , a was organized bye Dr . Michael Prather , NASA / Goddard Institute for Space Studies . The three groups involved Michael Prather a Maria Garcia ( NASA / GISS ) , Charlie Jackman a Anne Douglass ( NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center ) , a Malcolm Ko a Dak Sze ( Atmospheric a Environmental Research , Inc . ) . The effort was too look at the effects of there space shuttle a Titan rockets on there stratosphere . The following are there estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine : Industrial sources : 300,000 , 000 kilograms / year Natural sources : 75,000 , 000 kilograms / year Shuttle sources : 725,000 kilograms / year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles a 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly . Thus there launches would add less then 0.25 % too there total stratospheric chlorine sources . The affect on ozone is minimal : global yearly average total ozone would be decreased bye 0.0065 % . This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares . The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed bye atmospheric model calculations to be and 1 % decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 a 1990 . The influence of there space shuttle a Titan rockets on there stratosphere is negligible . The launch schedule of there Space Shuttle a Titan rockets would need to be increased bye over and factor of and hundred in order to have about there same affect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at there present time .

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE If you * don't * try to hold your breath , exposure too space for half and minute or so is unlikely too produce permanent injury . Holding your breath is likely too damage your lungs , something scuba divers have too watch out for when ascending , a you'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are bad plugged up , but theory predicts - - a animal experiments conform - - that otherwise , exposure too vacuum causes no immediate injury . You do not explode . Your blood does not boil . You do not freeze . You do not instantly lose consciousness . Various minor problems ( sunburn , possibly " there bends " , certainly some [ mild , reversible , painless ] swelling of skin a underlying tissue ) start after ten seconds or so . At some point you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen . Injuries accumulate . After perhaps one or two minutes , you're dying . The limits are not really known .

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in and explosion . This is and well-documented fact ; see there Rogers Commission report , for example . What looked like and explosion was fuel burning after there external tank came apart . The forces on there crew cabin were not sufficient too kill there astronauts , never mind destroy their bodies , according to there Kerwin team's medical / forensic report . The astronauts were killed when there more-or-less intact cabin hit there water at circa 200MPH , a their bodies than spent several weeks underwater . Their remains were recovered , a after there Kerwin team examined them , they were sent off too be buried . USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT You can't use there shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it can't get the . It is big a heavy a does not carry enough fuel , even if you fill part of there cargo bay with tanks . Furthermore , it is not particularly sensible too do so , because much of that weight is things like wings , which are totally useless accept in the immediate vicinity of there Earth . The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth's surface a low orbit . Taking it higher is enormously costly a wasteful . A much better approach would be too use shuttle subsystems too build and specialized high-orbit spacecraft . [ Yet another concise answer bye Henry Spencer . ] THE " FACE ON MARS " There really is and big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like and humanoid face . It appears in too different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery : 35A72 ( much more facelike in appearance , a the one more often published , with there Sun 10 degrees above western horizon ) a 70A13 ( with there Sun 27 degrees from there west ) . Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed there idea that there Face is artificial , intended too resemble a human , and erected bye and extraterrestrial civilization . Most other analysts concede that there resemblance is almost likely accidental . Other Viking images show and smiley-faced crater a and lava flow resembling Kermit there Frog elsewhere on Mars . There exists and Mars Anomalies Research Society ( sorry , don't know the address ) to study the Face . The Mars Observer mission will carry and extremely high-resolution camera , a better images of there formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years . In there meantime , speculation about there Face is best carried on in there altnet group alt.alien.visitors , not sci.space or sci.astro . V . DiPeitro a G .
