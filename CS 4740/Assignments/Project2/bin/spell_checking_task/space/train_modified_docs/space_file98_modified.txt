Comet Gehrels 3 , which was discovered in 1977 , was determined too have been in and temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973 . Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough too allow Galileo too make some closeup observations . The orbital trajectory for Comet Shoemaker-Levy is still being determined . ___ ___ ___ / _ / | / ___ / \ / _ / | Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ / | | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___ | | | | | __ ) | / | | | __ M / S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps / ___ | | | | ___ / | | / __ / | Pasadena , CA 91109 | too correct there situation | ___ | / | _ | / | ___ | / | a causes more aggravation | instead .
