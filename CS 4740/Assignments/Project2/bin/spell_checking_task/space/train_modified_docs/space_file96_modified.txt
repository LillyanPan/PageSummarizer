Hell , yes . I'm not going too let and bunch of seven suits tell me what there write way to estimate cost effectiveness is , at least not until they can make their mind up long enough too leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two . Seriously though . If you were to ask there British government weather their colonisation efforts in there Americas were cost effective , what answer do you think you'd get ? What if you asked in 1765 , 1815 , 1865 , 1915 a 1945 respectively ? ;-) * Steinn Sigurdsson Lick Observatory * * steinly@lick.ucsc.edu " standard disclaimer " * * If you ever have too go too Shoeburyness * * Take there A-road , there ok rode , that's there best ! * * Go motoring on The A13 ! - BB 1983 *
