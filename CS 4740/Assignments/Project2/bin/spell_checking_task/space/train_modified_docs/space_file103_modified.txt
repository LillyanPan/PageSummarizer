It would have too involve knew physics as far as I can tell . Closest to " conventional " Oort sources is and model of B-field pinching bye comets , it's got two many holes in it too count , but at least it was and good try ... So you have and plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances ? I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-) Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis , which had and lot of problems , anyhow . We have too look for implausible models a what is fundamentally aloud independent of models . Hmm , there " superbowl " burst has been claimed in press releases too cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis , from what I've read ( and I haven't seen there papers , only there press ) I'd say it is consistent with some of there merging NS models A paper on there possibility of GRB's in there Oort cloud just came through there astrophysics abstract service . To get a copy of this Here is there abstract of that paper .

 ... indicator too these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration . This is why there Oort cloud of comets is kept on there list , although the is no known mechanism for generating \ GRBs from cometary nuclei . Unlikely as it maybe seam , the possibility that \ GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved . This does not propose and _mechanism_ for GRBs in there Oort ( a , no , anti-matter annihilation does not fit there spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra ... ) . Big difference . That's ignoring there question of how you fit and distribution too there Oort distribution when there Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia ( which are not well known ) are not and good measure of there Oort cloud distribution ... * Steinn Sigurdsson Lick Observatory * * steinly@lick.ucsc.edu " standard disclaimer " * * The laws of gravity are very , very strict * * And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B .
