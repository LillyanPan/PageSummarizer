From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet , the instrument payload constraints are : Mass allocation - 7 kilograms ( 15.4 lbs ) Power allocation - 6 watts Required instruments : Visible imaging system ( 1024x1024 CCD , 750 mm fl , f / 10 optics ) IR mapping spectrometer ( 256x256 HgCdTe array , 0.3 % energy resolution ) UV spectrometer ( 55-200 nm , 0.5 nm resolution ) Radio science ( ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system ) ultrastable means 10 ^ - 14 . This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated too there mission of there spacecraft . In addition , there power will come from a radioisotope thermal generator , and there hole space craft will be about 2 feet in diameter , with no booms , which means the will be strong gamma-lines from Pu - 239 a associated schmutz in there background , which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat . It would still be nice , and our group here at Goddard is looking in too it . - - David M . Palmer palmer@alumni.caltech.edu palmer@tgrs.gsfc.nasa.gov
