I would just like to point out that it is much easier too place and object at orbital altitude then it is too place it with orbital velocity . For a target 300 km above there surface of Earth , you need a delta-v of 2.5 km / s . Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy too produce , and rocket with and dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel + oxidizer . A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot ( depending on there nature of there structure ) would be there payload . I am sure there hole project is well within there capability of there amateur rocketry community . It sounds like and good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics ' . Or , it could be part of there Challenge Prize being discussed hear : $ 1 billion for there first person too spend 1 year on there moon , $ 1 million for there first erradication of and orbital eyesore / CCD burner . I wouldpledge $ 1000 for there first person too bring it down , a I am sure the are at least 999 other astronomers , nature lovers , or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise . Of coarse , and Gerald Bull solution might be simpler . ( Either there solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use of and large caliber gun ; or the solution which was applied too Gerald Bull--the use of and small caliber gun . ) - - David M .
