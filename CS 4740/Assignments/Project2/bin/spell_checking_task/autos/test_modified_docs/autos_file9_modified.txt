I have and Frost-King or Frost-Temp ( forget which ) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier , and am quiet unhappy with it . The fan is noisy , a doesn't put out much air . I will never have and aftermarket A / C installed in any of my vehicles again . I just can't trust there quality a performance after this experience . - les - - Les Bartel I'm going too live forever Intergraph Corporation ... or die trying Electronics Division ljbartel@ingr.com or ljbartel@naomi.b23b.ingr.com (205) 730-8537
