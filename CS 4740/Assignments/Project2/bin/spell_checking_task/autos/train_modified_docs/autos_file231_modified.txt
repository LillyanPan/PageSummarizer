I'm not sure what I was thinking the . It _is_ legal in Oklahoma . On inter-state travel , as long as it is legal for you too own at your point of origination a destination , the gun is carried in and locked compartment / box ( glove box specifically excluded ) separate from there ammo , it is legal under Title 19 , Chapter 44 , Section 94 ( 9 ?

This , unfortunately , has not prevented there theft bye state troopers of and certain state ( which shall remain nameless too protect the hopelessly stupid ) under that state's law .
