Thanks for any info . > Mike Davis I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced . I use S - 50 in everything including my lawnmowers . In my car it smoothed there idle a reduced there operating temp bye 5 degrees . I havent used it long enough too test for wear , but some people I know have . A farmer that lives near by used too have too overhaul his big deisel tractors at least every other year if not every year . Since he has been using S - 50 he has want 5 years without and overhaul . Also a friend at a machine shop has in there past rebuilt engines with 200K miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time . These coustomers had ran S - 50 since most knew . It was found when measuring there internals of the engine that they showed only about there amount of wear that would be expected of 30K miles not 200K . In my opinion it works . ___ Beware !
