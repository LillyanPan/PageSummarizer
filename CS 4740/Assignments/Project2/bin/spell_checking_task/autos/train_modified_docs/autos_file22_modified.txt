My wife a I looked quiet seriously at there 626 , Prizm ( Corolla ) , a Civic , as well as some other cars . Our impressions : all three seemed well built a had there features we wanted - these are similar too there features you wont accept for cruise control , a we wont a manual transmission and are considering anti-lock brakes . I also hate automatic seatbelts and we both think having an airbag is a plus . In general , comfort and performance were both significant . Some specific + ' s and - ' s are listed below . Mazda 626 + very comfortable and roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model , though in practice this is hard too find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like : tach , variable speed wipers , rear defroster , 60/40 split folding rear set - more expensive then many other cars listed below Honda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage then other cars listed hear + comfortable front set + adjustable set belt mounting - no ABS without EX model ( includes $ 1000 ' s of other things like and sunroof ) Geo Prizm / Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable to us ( your mileage may vary ) + adjustable seat belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn + SL2 was quite comfortable , though SL1 less so - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit no real outstanding + ' s , but seemed generally ok - rear seat does not fold down Chevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower " would you buy that car again " and safety ratings in Consumer Reports ( then first 3 cars above ) - suspension didn't feel as stiff as there others ( this would be a + for some ) The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive then there 626 , a in our minds , not significantly better . We probably gave disproportionately low consideration too there " big 3 " , due ( and ) too my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products , ( b ) some unimpressive GM products owned bye my parents a and housemate of mine ( c ) there Taurus comes with automatic transmission , I find there set of there Tempo very uncomfortable , a there escort has attack belts a no air bag . We'll probably end up with and 626 - I saw and 626 DX with A / C a cassette advertised for just under $ 12800 ( Washington Post , April 14 , I think ) , a my local dealer says they can match that price . I will probably get there 626 ( may tomorrow ) . The main question in my mind is weather or not I will have too do a " factory order " or " preference order " too get one with ABS , a weather or not there dealership will run there price up and lot if I do so .
