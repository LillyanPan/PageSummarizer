I'd assume easier , > since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting > gasses . Let's here people's opinions ... The technology Cummins is applying too diesels too comply with the newer Ca . emissions laws involves three things I know of : 1 . All compliant diesels are turbocharged . 2 . All use and " aftercooler " , which cools the air which was heated bye compression bye there turbocharger ( up to about 25 PSI ) . 3 . A gismo on there injector pump which senses there pressurized air intake , a limits full delivery of fuel while there pressure is low . No scrubbers , catalytic converters , etc , are used . The path from there turbocharger to there exhaust outlet is kept very free . Interestingly , accept for there low-pressure fuel limitation , power output a mileage are enhanced bye these measures . One can bye aftermarket turbos a aftercoolers which generate more power , lots more power , a these are approved bye there CARB . Dan Hepner
