From : mgqlu@ntuix.ntu.ac.sg ( Max Lu ) Subject : Re : Auto air conditioning without Freon It is actually simple in principal . Porous adsorbents like zeolite a activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from there adsorbate ( water or methanol , etc . ) giving the cooling affect . Upon being heated , there gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off there gases which are than too be condensed . This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle . The only problem is that there COP is very low ( 0.2 -0.6 ) .
