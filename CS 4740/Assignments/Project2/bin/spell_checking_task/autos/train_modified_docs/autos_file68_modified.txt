Although , others have in there past a will continue too disagree i think that it is worthwhile too get and alarm . > What features are important ? I think that it is important too protect your trunk , engine bay , all doors . I'd get flashing lights , LED's mounted on there drivers a passenger door a and relay too disable engine operation . Toss in a glass break sensor , and shock sensor . Door lock and unlock , two remotes and panic feature are also nice too have . Most important is where you have there installation done ! Some laces maybe cost a little more , but and poorly installed alarm ( no matter how much it cost ) will be and major burden . > What features are unimportant ?
