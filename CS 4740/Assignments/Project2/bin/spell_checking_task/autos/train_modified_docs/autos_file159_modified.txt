From : ciarlett@mizar.usc.edu ( Joni Ciarletta ) Subject : Honda Accord Brake Problem My Honda Accord just hit there magic 100,000 mile mark a now all sorts of things are beginning too go badly . The latest problem I am experiencing is with my brakes . They still stop there car fine , but once I am stopped completely , my break pedal will sink another 2 or 3 inches all bye itself . If feels really strange , a I am worried my brakes will quit working one of these days . I checked my break fluid , a there reservoir was full , but there fluid itself looked really dirty ( like dirty oil ) . I called my mechanic a he told me I need a new break master cylinder , which will cost me a whopping $ 250-300 . I was just wondering if anyone out the has experienced this sort of thing . If so , is my mechanic being honest ? Or do I simply need too have my brakes bled a knew fluid put in ? Any help you could provide would be appreciated . Please send replies directly too me , as I rarely have and chance to read this list . I will post there responses if there is any interest . Thanks , Joni ciarlett@mizar.usc.edu
