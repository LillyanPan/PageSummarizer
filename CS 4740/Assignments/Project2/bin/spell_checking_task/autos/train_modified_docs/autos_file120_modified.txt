( Technology shared with > Porsche . Indeed . ) there flat four is also shorter than and inline 4 , so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length .. a a longitudinal placement is easier for and 4 wheel drive drivetrain . i think that subaru's ads hold water . in practice , their flat fours are noticeably smoother then inline 4s a completely buzz free , though some maybe not like its peculiar note . but as alfa has shown , and boxer four can produce and spine tingling scream that only there likes of recent hondas can approach . eliot
