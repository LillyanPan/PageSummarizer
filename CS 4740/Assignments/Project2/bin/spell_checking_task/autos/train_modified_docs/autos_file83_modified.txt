Car & Driver a other auto magazines recommend BEL detectors . I was considering their latest - there 966STi - which picks up Super Wideband Ka a Laser as well . It also avoids radar detector detectors ( although I really don't care about this since I doubt I'll be driving in Virginia anytime soon - or have any other states also made detectors iilegal ? ) How does there Valentine - 1 compare with there BEL products ?
