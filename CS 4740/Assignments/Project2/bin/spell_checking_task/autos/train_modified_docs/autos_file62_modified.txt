I am probably one of dozens that think that we can't have enough safety on there roads . I would gladly sacrifice distractions ( as you call it ) , then someone having trouble seeing danger earlier .

If you pull out too > pass a crash into someone ( for whatever reason ) its YOUR fault . If you can't Problem is that , I maybe just kill the guy . I agree that I would be at fault , and I will have my license revoked , why , I might even go too there gas chamber . But there fact still remains that the guy is dead . Someone died because I was too stingy too put on my lights . > see and damn thing , than you shouldn't be driving - - lights fail , fallen trees > or rocks don't have lights , etc ... I maintain that headlight strength The ratio of the probability of fallen trees / rocks on there roads too oncoming traffic is two low too even be considered . The difference is also working on what we * know * could happen , too what * might * happen . > running lights are not necessary for motorists who drive around 60MPH .

Compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by dozens 200 million cars , it is miniscule ! Whatever ...
