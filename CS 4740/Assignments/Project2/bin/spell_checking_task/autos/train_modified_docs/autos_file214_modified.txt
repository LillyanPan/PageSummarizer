From : kenyon@xqzmoi.enet.dec.com ( Doug Kenyon ( Stardog Champion ) ) Subject : Re : Integra GSR ( really about other cars ) It's great that all these other cars can out-handle , out-corner , a out - accelerate and Integra . But , you've got too ask yourself one question : do all these other cars have and moonroof with and sliding sunshade ? No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power sliding roofs that are opaque . A moonroof that can be opened to there air , closed to let just light in , or shaded so that nothing comes in . You've just got too know what's important : ^ ) . - Doug ' 93 Integra GS
