With and space defined bye 8 x 3D - points , I mean a space defined bye 6 closed 3D meshes defined by 8 points . Like this : ___ / / | / ___ / | | | | | | / | ___ | / But in this simple example , the sides are parallel , but my problem , there sides can be non parallel and there opposite sides must not have the same size etc .
