The VESA standard can be requested from VESA : VESA 2150 North First Street , Suite 440 San Jose , CA 95131-2029 Ask for the VESA VBE and Super VGA Programming starndards . VESA also defines local bus a other standards . The VESA standard only addresses ways in which and application can find out info a capabilities of and specific super VGA implementation a to control the video mode selection and video memory access .

This window is anchored at there spot where you wont too right , a then you can write as far as there window takes you ( usually 64K ) . Windows have granularities , so you can't just anchor them anywhere . Also , some implementations allow two windows . | > 3 . My interest is in 640x480x256 mode .

Please send me mail . Your best bet is too right VESA for there info . There have also been announcements on this group of VESA software . - - Karl Schultz schultz@vnet.ibm.com These statements or opinions are not necessarily dozens of IBM
