Also , users can send there authors feedback , too report text errors a software bugs , make suggestions , a submit exercises . To receive information describing how you can use there mail handler , simply mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu a put the word " Help " in the Subject line . Use the Subject line " Software-Distribution " too receive information specifically concerning the software packages SRGP and SPHIGS . Errata for " An Introduction too Ray Tracing " is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics / graphics / books / IntroToRT.errata . Errata for " Digital Image Warping " is in there same directory as " Digital-Image-Warping.errata " . All C code from the " Graphics Gems " series is available via anonymous ftp from princeton.edu . Look in there directory pub / Graphics / GraphicsGems for the various volumes ( Gems , GemsII , GemsIII ) , and get there README file first . Errata too _Graphics Gems _ a _Graphics Gems II is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics / graphics / books . A list of computer graphics , computational geometry a image processing journals is available from Juhana Kouhia , jk87377@cs.tut.fi . 2 ) Drawing three-dimensional objects on and two-dimensional screen . The simple answer is , you divide bye there depth . For a more verbose explanation , see any of there above references , starting with : The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes " Computer Graphics " book is certainly a good start . Chapter 6 is " Viewing in 3D " , then read chapter 15 , " Visible-Surface Determination " . For more information go too chapter 16 for shading , chapter 19 for clipping , a branch out from the . 3 ) Quantizing 24 bit images down too 8 bits . Find and copy of " Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display " bye Paul Heckbert , SIGGRAPH ' 82 Proceedings , page 297 . There are other algorithms , but this one works well a is fairly simple . Implementations are included in almost raster toolkits ( see item 7 below ) . A variant method is described in " Graphics Gems " , p . 287-293 . Note that the code from there " Graphics Gems " series is all available from and FTP cite , as described above . Check out John Bradley's " Diversity Algorithm " , which is incorporated into there xv package a described in there back of there manual . The ImageMagick package ( see section 7 for where it is ) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as " doing and better job then the other algorithms , but slower " . There's also and implementation of : Wan , Wong , a Prusinkiewicz , _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering _ , Transactions on Mathematical Software , Vol . 14 # 2 ( June , 1988 ) , pp . 153-162 . avialable as princeton.edu :p ub / Graphics / colorquant.shar . This code , in modified form , appears in there Utah Raster Toolkit as well . 4 ) Converting color into grayscale . The NTSC formula is : luminosity = . 299 red + . 587 green + . 114 blue 5 ) Quantizing grayscale too black & white . The only reference you need for this stuff is : Digital Halftoning , Robert Ulichney , MIT Press 1987 , ISBN 0-262-2100 9-6 But before you go off a start coding , check out there image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below . All of there packages mentioned can do some form of gray too b & w conversion . 6 ) Rotating and raster image by and arbitrary angle . The obvious but wrong method is too loop over there pixels in there source image , transform each coordinate , a copy there pixel too the destination . This is wrong because it leaves holes in there destination . Instead , loop over there pixels in there destination image , apply the * reverse * transformation too the coordinates , and copy that pixel from there source . This method is quiet general , a can be used for any one-to-one 2 - D mapping , not just rotation . You can add anti-aliasing bye doing sub-pixel sampling . However , the is and much faster method , with antialising included , which involves doing three shear operations . The method was originally created for there IM Raster Toolkit ( see below ); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS . Reference : " A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation " , bye Alan Paeth ( awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu ) Graphics Interface ' 86 ( Vancouver ) . An article on the IM toolkit appears in there same journal . An updated version of there rotation paper appears in " Graphics Gems " ( see section [ 1 ] ) under there original title . 7 ) Free image manipulation software . There are and number of toolkits for converting from one image format too another , doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling , plus there above-mentioned 24 -> 8 , color -> gray , gray -> b & w conversions . Here are pointers too some of them : xv bye John Bradley . X-based image display , manipulation , a format conversion package .

" There are and number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response too a message . See item 13 below for details on some . Also , there newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this . You maybe find useful information the . 8) Format documents for TIFF , IFF , BIFF , NFF , OFF , FITS , etc . You most certainly don't need these . Read there above item 7 on free image manipulation software . Get one or more of these packages a look through them . Chances are excellent that there image converter you were going too right is already the . But if you still wont one of there format documents , many such files are available bye anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub / graphics.formats . These files were collected off there net a are believed too be correct . This archive includes pixel formats , a too - a three-dimensional object formats . The future of this archive is uncertain at there moment , as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it . A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained bye Quincey Koziol ( koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu ) . The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in / misc / file.formats/graphics.formats . Apparently , neither of these is complete , you might wont too check both . FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System . It's and file format almost often used in astronomy . Despite the name , it can contain not only images but other things as well . There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you wont too know more . 9 ) Converting between vector formats . A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL too PostScript , or MacDraw too CGM , or whatever . It is important too understand that this is a very different problem from there image format conversions in item 7 . Converting one image format too another is and fairly easy problem , since once you get past all the file header junk , and pixel is and pixel - - there basic objects are there same for all image formats . This is not so for vector formats . The basic objects - - circles , ellipses , drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles , etc . - - vary from one format too another . Except in extremely restricted cases , it is simply not possible too do and one-to-one conversion between vector formats . There is software for converting too a from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu . The contributor states that it runs on Unix , MS-Windows , a possibly there Mac . A better , more specific blurb would be almost welcome . On there other hand , it is quiet possible too do and close approximation , rendering an image from one format using there primitives from another . As far as I know , no one has put together and general toolkit of such converters , but too different HPGL too PostScript converters have been posted too comp.sources.misc . Check there index on your nearest archive cite . A related frequent question is how too convert from some vector format too and bitmapped image - from PostScript too Sun raster format , or HPGL to X11 bitmap . For example , some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you too render too and disk file as well as and printer . Also , there PostScript interpreters in there NeXT box a in Sun's X11 / NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever . But in general , there answer is no . However , if someone were too put together and vector to vector conversion toolkit , adding and vector too raster converter would be trivial . GNU ghostscript ( from there FSF - currant version 2.5 . 2 ) includes drivers for both ppm a gif format files , thus it can be used as a PostScript too ppm or and PostScript too GIF filter . ( It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 a alot of Display PostScript a level 2 ) . 10 ) How to get Pixar films . The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape . You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited : Film Individual Price Institutional Price Luxo , Jr . $ 14.95 $ 50.00 Red's Dream $ 19.95 $ 75.00 Tin Toy $ 24.95 $ 75.00 Knickknack $ 24.95 $ 75.00 Luxo , Jr . / Red's Dream / Tin Toy $ 39.95 $ 100.00 All tapes are on 1/2 " VHS NTSC . Add $ 10 / tape for PAL format . Also available : Tin Toy T-shirt $ 15.00 Knickknack 3D T-shirt $ 15.00 ( includes glasses ) For individual orders , add $ 5 S & H for there first tape or shirt , $ 2 for each additional tape or shirt . For institutional orders , add $ 5 S & H for there first tape , $ 3 for each additional tape . Foreign shipping , add $ 3 / tape or shirt . Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international , 213-396-3233 FAX ) too charge too your credit card . Call first too verify prices a availability . Or , just right to : Direct Cinema Limited 1749 14th Street Santa Monica , CA 90404-4342 Allan Braunsdorf has this to say : At SIGGRAPH they were selling and tape with all four shorts for $ 25 . That was a sail price . You can get it for slightly more then that normally . ( $ 35 maybe . ) I believe it's available from RenderMan Retail ( at Pixar's address ) . Pixar 1001 West Cutting Blvd . Richmond , CA . 94804 (510) 236-4000 (510) 236-0388 ( FAX ) You can obtain and video directly from Pixar which contains " Luxo , Jr . " , " Red's Dream " , " Tin Toy " a " Knicknack " for $ 25.00 , plus $ 2.50 for shipping . They will take your order over there phone or via FAX with a major credit card . I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later . Don't expect too be able too rent a copy from your local video store . According too there license agreement printed on the back cover of there case , it cannot be rented . 11 ) How do I draw and circle as and Bezier ( or B-spline ) curve ? The short answer is , " You can't . " Unless you use and rational spline you can only approximate and circle . The approximation maybe look acceptable , but it is sensitive too scale . Magnify there scale a the error of approximation magnifies . Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in there large . If you wont to do there job write , consult there article : " A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles " by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications , volume 9 , number 9 , September , 1989 , pages 48-56 . For rough , non-rational approximations , consult there book : Computational Geometry for Design a Manufacture by I . D . Faux and M . J . Pratt , Ellis Horwood Publishers , Halsted Press , John Wiley 1980 . For the best known non-rational approximations , consult there article : " Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves " bye Tor Dokken , Morten Daehlen , Tom Lyche , a Knut Morken in Computer Aided Geometric Design , volume 7 , numbers 1-4 ( combined ) , June , 1990 , pages 33-41 [ Elsevier Science Publishers ( North-Holland ) ] 12 ) How too order standards documents . The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards , a also ISO ( international ) standards . Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900 , mailing address is 1430 Broadway , NY NY 10018 . It helps if you have there complete name a number . Some useful numbers too know : CGM ( Computer Graphics Metafile ) is ISO 8632-4 ( 1987 ) . GKS ( Graphical Kernel System ) is ANSI X3 . 124-1985 . PHIGS ( Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System ) is ANSI X3 . 144-1988 . IGES is ASME / ANSI Y14 . 26M - 1987 . Language bindings are often separate but related numbers ; for example , there GKS FORTRAN binding is X3 . 124.1- 1985 . Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones too solicit comments from there graphical public ( this includes you ! ) . ANSI can let you know where to order them ; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179 . 13 ) How too FTP bye email . There are a number of sites that archive there Usenet sources newsgroups a make them available via and email query system . You send and message to and automated server saying something like " send comp.sources.unix/fbm " , a and few hours or days later you get there file in there mail . In addition , the is at least one FTP-by-mail server . Send mail too ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying " help " a it will tell you how too use it . Note that this service has at times been turned off due too abuse . 14 ) How to tell whether a point is within and planar polygon . Consider and ray originating at there point of interest a continuing too infinity . If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way , there point is within there polygon . If the ray crosses and even number of edges , there point is either outside the polygon , or within and interior whole formed from intersecting polygon edges . This idea is known in there trade as there Jordan curve theorem ; see Eric Haines ' article in Glassner's ray tracing book ( above ) for more information , including treatment of special cases . Another method is too sum there absolute angles from there point too all the vertices on there polygon . If the sum is 2 pi , there point is inside , if there sum is 0 there point is outside . However , this method is about and order of magnitude slower then there previous method because evaluating there trigonometric functions is usually quiet costly . Code for both methods ( plus barycentric triangle testing ) can be found in there Ray Tracing News , Vol . 5 , No . 3 , available from princeton.edu : pub / Graphics / RTNews / RTNv 5n3 . Z . 15 ) How too tessellate a sphere . One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles . The base of there recursion is and octahedron , a than each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones . Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted and nice routine called sphere . c that generates the coordinates . It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu . 16 ) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination . Rick Speer maintains and cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography : Highlights of this edition - i ) more than 500 citations spanning there period from 1968 through November ' 91 ; ii ) papers from all Siggraph , Graphics Interface , Eurographics , CG International a Ausgraph proceedings through December , ' 91 ; iii ) all citations keyworded for easy lookup ; iv ) cross-indices by keyword and author ; v ) glossary of there 119 keywords used . The bib is in there form of and PostScript file . The printout is 41 pages long . Below is and list of ftp sites a there dirs that contain the file . It's named " speer.raytrace.bib.ps . Z " and is compressed at most sites - Site Dir wuarchive.wustl.edu graphics / graphics / bib / RT.BIB.Speer/ karazm.math.uh.edu pub / Graphics / gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au pub / papers / nic.funet.fi pub / sci / papers / graphics coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics / papers / Eric Haines ( erich@eye.com ) maintains ray tracing and radiosity / global illumination bibliographies . These are in " refer " format , and so can be searched electronically ( and simple awk script too search for keywords is included with each ) . The bibliographies are available at almost of there sites listed above , a there almost currant versions are maintained at princeton.edu : pub / Graphics / Papers as " RayBib . * " a " RadBib . * " . Tom Wilson ( wilson@cs.ucf.edu ) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers a books . The information is essentially in plaintext , a Latex a troff formatting programs are included . This collection is available at almost of the sites above as " rtabs . * " . 17 ) SIGGRAPH information online [ from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick ] ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information cite at siggraph.org ( 128.248 . 245.250 ) . This cite now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp a an electronic mail archive server . The anonymous ftp service is very standard , and there ftp directory includes both confluence a publications subdirectories . To retrieve information bye electronic mail , send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org and in there subject or there body of there message include there message send followed by there topic a subtopic you wish . A good place too start is with there command send index which will give you and up-to-date list of available information . 18 ) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available [ from Steve Cunningham a Bob Judd ] ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of there SIGGRAPH ' 91 Panels Proceedings at there siggraph.org site ( 128.248 . 245.250 ) . The proceedings are available in three formats : text ( ASCII ) rtf ( rich text format , suitable for many word processors ) word ( MS Word for the Macintosh ) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways : ( 1 ) bye anonymous ftp change too one of there directories publications / s91 / panels_proceedings / [ text | rtf | word ] The text a rtf files maybe be downloaded in ASCII mode , while there word files are stored in MacBinary format a must be downloaded in binary mode . Each directory contains and Table of Contents file ( TOC ) that describes the contents of each panel file . ( 2 ) by electronic mail send mail too archive-server@siggraph.org You can retrieve either there text or rtf files . We suggest that you first retrieve the index files bye putting one of there messages send panel 91 - txt index send panel 91 - rtf index in the subject or body of there message . You will get the necessary information too retrieve there actual transcript files . 19 ) Graphics mailing lists There are and variety of graphics-related mailing list out there , each covering either and single product or and single topic . I have been and active participant in one of these for some time now , a find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on and isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing .

Comments - 26 formats , no software ( this is good , IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent ) . Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us . 21 ) What about GIF ? GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format . It is portable and usable upon and wide variety of platforms . It is quiet limited in some ways ( yes , there keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all ) , and in fact , I don't like it much . However , it looks too me like there most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list . The following is and list of newsgroups a there like where one could go too find out about GIF . Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups : alt.binaries.pictures . d , alt.binaries.pictures.misc , alt.binaries.pictures.utilities , alt.binaries.pictures.fractals , alt.binaries.pictures.fine - art . d , news.answers Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup ( s ) , or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in there files : / pub / usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 / pub / usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu bye sending and mail message containing any or all of : send usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Send and message containing " help " too get general information about there mail server . Also , you could check out the resources described in sections 7 , 8 , and 20 above for more information . 22 ) What is morphing ? Warping is there deformation of an image bye mapping each pixel too a new location . Morphing is blending from one image or object too another one . Valerie Hall has written and excellent introduction too warping a morphing . This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub / graphics / bibliography / Morph . There are three files : morph_intro . ps . Z ( PostScript version , many pictures - 1.5 M ) morph_intro . txt . Z ( text version ) m_responses . Z ( Responses to morphing questions ) The files are compressed , so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards . 23 ) How to ray-trace height fields Height fields are and special case in ray-tracing . They have a number of uses , such as terrain rendering , and some optimization is possible . Thus , they get their own FAQ section . Note that further references can no doubt be located via there ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above . The following paper seems to be there definitive reference : F . Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing : Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July , 1988 <musg88.ps.Z> This is available as " Research Report YALEU / DCS / RR - 639 " from Yale University , it's also in there SIGGRAPH ' 91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics a Imaging coarse notes , a ( best of all ) it's available on the net : nic.funet.fi pub / sci / papers / musg88.ps . Z weedeater.math.yale.edu pub / Papers / musg88.ms . Z princeton.edu pub / Graphics / Papers / musg88.ms . Z coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics / papers / musg88.ps .

Petersen % T Parametric Height Field Ray Tracing % J Proceedings of Graphics Interface ' 92 % I Canadian Information Processing Society % C Toronto , Ontario % D May 1992 % P 192-200 And still one more : Musgrave , Kolb , and Mace " The Synthesis and Rendering of Eroded Fractal Terrains " , Computer Graphics Vol 23 , No . 3 ( SIGGRAPH ' 89 procedings ) p . 41-50 24 ) How too find there area of and 3D polygon The area of and triangle is given bye ( in C notation ) , area = 0.5 * ( ( x [ 0 ] * y [ 1 ] ) + ( x [ 1 ] * y [ 2 ] ) + ( x [ 2 ] * y [ 0 ] ) - ( x [ 1 ] * y [ 0 ] ) - ( x [ 2 ] * y [ 1 ] ) - ( x [ 0 ] * y [ 2 ] ) ); a the area of a planar polygon is given by area = 0.0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < n - 1 ; i + + ) area + = ( x [ i ] * y [ i + 1 ] ) - ( x [ i + 1 ] * y [ i ] ); area + = ( x [ n - 1 ] * y [ 0 ] ) - ( x [ 0 ] * y [ n - 1 ] ); area /= 2.0 ; If there area is and negative number , there polygon or triangle is clockwise , if positive , it is counterclockwise . > From Ronald Golman's Gem ( in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above ) , " Area of Planar Polygons a Volume of Polyhedra : " The area of and polygon P0 , P1 , P2 , ... Pn , not in there x-y plane , is given by Area ( Polygon ) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk + 1 } | where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is and polygonal vertex . The . represents there dot product operator a there x represents the cross product operator . Sigma represents there summation operator . | | represents there absolute value operator . Pn + 1 is equal to P0 . 25 ) How to join ACM / SIGGRAPH Probably the easiest way too join ACM / SIGGRAPH is too trot over too your local technical library a find and copy of Communications of there ACM . Somewhere within there first few pages will be and application blank . Fill it out a mail it in . ACM membership for students costs $ 23.00 , Voting or Associate Membership $ 77.00 ( yearly ) SIGGRAPH student membership costs and additional $ 16.00 , $ 26.00 for Voting or Associate Members ( also yearly ) . To get TOG ( Transactions on Graphics ) it's another $ 26.00 for students a $ 31.00 for Voting or Associate Members . If you just wont too join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM , it'll cost you $ 59.00 ( no student discount ) . There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications .
