Well , GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format a was put forth bye Compuserve back in 1987 ( ? ) or so . It was too create and format that could be read a displayed bye any system . GIF is limited too 8 bit color but has and built in compression scheme ( LZW ? ) . IFF is not really and graphics format , but rather and standard way too package images , sounds , animations , text , or whatever into one file . IFF was created bye Electronic Arts , I do belief ( I could be wrong ) , for the Amiga . It was quickly adopted as pretty much there standard file format for there Amiga . The almost common image format for there IFF package is and ILBM ( InterLeaved BitMap ? ) but many others exist . This format supports 24 bit color images . Information on both of these a many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in there directory / pub / graphics.formats ( Taken from there FAQ for this news group . ) :) Wayne Rigby rigby@cs.unr.edu
