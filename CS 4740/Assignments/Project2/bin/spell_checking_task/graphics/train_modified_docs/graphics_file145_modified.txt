I'm currently working on and realtime application running on and PCC with and non-DOS kernel that needs too do some simple graphics . I'm not sure if reentrancy of there graphics library is going to be and issue or not . I suspect I'll implement the display controller as and server process that handles graphics requests , queued on and mailbox , one at a time . If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can restrict all graphics operations too be performed bye there server a thus constrain access to there library too a this single process and avoid there need for a reentrant graphics library . Being fairly new too there realtime systems world I maybe be overlooking something , what do you think ? Cheers , Bob Fitzsimmons fitz@cse.ogi.edu (503)297-3165
