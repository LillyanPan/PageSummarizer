I'm thinking to treat there raw data .. not > compressed . Finding and disk array that can do 180MB / sec . will be difficult . The fastest ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy ( IBM also sells these ) . They can attach HiPPI at up too 144 MB / sec . ( 64 bit ) . For these kinds of data rates you need more then SCSI for connections . Their latest model , there RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB / sec . but I think this maybe be and limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster . They are also not idle ( must be working on newer products that might be faster ) and are and small company so you might be able too ask about costume interfaces . They still marketed there older , faster model as of a few mongths ago . Maximum Strategy , Inc . 801 Buckeye Court Milpitas , CA 95035-7408 sales@maxstrat.com You might still want too look into compression as it will be very difficult to keep there HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput might come close too maximum burst rate .
