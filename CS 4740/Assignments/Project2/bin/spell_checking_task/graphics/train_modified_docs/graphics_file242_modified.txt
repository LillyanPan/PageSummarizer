There is no way in HELL you are going too be able too view GIFs or do any other graphics in Linux without X windows ! I love Linux because it is so easy too learn .. You wont text ? Okay . Use Linux . You want text AND graphics ? Use Linux with X windows . Simple . Painless . REQUIRED too have X Windows if you wont graphics ! This includes fancy word processors like doc , image viewers like xv , etc .
