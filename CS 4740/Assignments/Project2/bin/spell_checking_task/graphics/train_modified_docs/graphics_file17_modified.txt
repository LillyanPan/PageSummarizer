From : ernie@woody.apana.org.au ( Ernie Elu ) Subject : MGR NAPLPS & GUI BBS Frontends Hi all , I am looking into methods I can use too turn my Linux based BBS into and full color Graphical BBS that supports PC , Mac , Linux , a Amiga callers . Originally I was inspired bye there NAPLPS graphics standard ( and summary of which hit this group about 2 weeks ago ) . Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that almost terminal programs are commercial there only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac a Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they wont too try out there BBS ( I know I wouldn't ) Next almost interesting possibility is to port MGR too PC , Mac , Amiga . I know the is an old version of and Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seam too find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it . Is the and color version of MGR for Linux ? I know the was and alpha version of there libs out last year but I misplaced it . Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported too PC or Amiga ? I can't seam to send and message too there MGR channel without it bouncing . Does anyone have any other suggestions for and Linux based GUI BBS ? Thanks in advan
