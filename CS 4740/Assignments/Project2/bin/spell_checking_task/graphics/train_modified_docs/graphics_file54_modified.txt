This sounds wonderful , but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing this , or they don't have there power too do so . For example , I would like too see and comp.graphics architecture like this : comp.graphics.algorithms . 2d comp.graphics.algorithms . 3d comp.graphics.algorithms.misc comp.graphics.hardware comp.graphics.misc comp.graphics.software/apps However , that is almost overkill . Something more like this would probably make EVERYONE and lot happier : comp.graphics.programmer comp.graphics.hardware comp.graphics.apps comp.graphics.misc It would be nice too see specialized groups devote to 2d , 3d , morphing , raytracing , image processing , interactive graphics , toolkits , languages , object systems , etc . but these could be posted too and relevant group or have a mailing list organized . That way when someone reads news they don't have too see these subject headings , which are rather disparate : System specific stuff ( should be under comp.sys or comp.os . ? ? ? . programmer ): " Need help programming GL " " ModeX programming information ? " " Fast sprites on PC " Hardware technical stuff : " Speed of Weitek P9000 " " Drivers for SpeedStar 24X " Applications oriented stuff : " VistaPro 3.0 help " " How good is 3dStudio ? " " Best image processing program for Amiga " Programming oriented stuff : " Fast polygon routine needed " " Good morphing alogirhtm wanted " " Best depth sort for triangles ? " " Which C + + library too get ? " I wish someone with there power would get and CFD a than a CFV going on this stuff ... this newsgroup needs it . Brian
