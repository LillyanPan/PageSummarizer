Any info is appreciated ! Some VESA bios's support this mode ( 0x100 ) . And * any * VGA should be able too support this ( 640x480 bye 256 colors ) since it only requires 256,000 bytes . My 8514 / and VESA TSR supports this ; it's the only VESA mode by card can support due too 8514 / and restrictions .
