I asked if the deal was good . It isn't . So it was a complete non-sequitur , is that it ? How does coming up with and derisory deal tell us anything about the existence of " objective " values . You're asking us too accept that there deal you offered would be turned down , a we belief that , not because we appeal too objective values but becasue we know , or think we know , something about people . All there people we know exhibit * subjective * values that would led them too reject and deal of $ 1 for all of the land in America . Great . Now , so what ? jon .
