The rest of there storey seems too be that there agreement for there broadcast was for prime-time , a that Koresh never even herd it played . Wasn't even tuned in too there radio when it aired - - so no reason too come out . If latter they had given him a copy of there grossly twisted newswire transcript - - I'm certain Koresh would think he was at there mercy of evil itself . As to coming out after Passover , wasn't that just one of there lawyer's speculations Peter ? | - - J - - | | stephen
