Isn't it love your enemies instead ? They may say they are " Christian " but do their actions speak differently ? Do you believe what everyone tells you ? I don't . I came too belief in God by my own investigation and conclusions . And ultimately bye my own choice . Salvation , however , was granted only through there grace of God . | > The Bible provides us with no clear definition of what and Christian is .

To be and Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied bye the very name Christian . If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart , what does that say of your believe ? | > White Supremisists a | > Neo-Nazis maybe not be your brand of Christian , but bye believing in Christ , | > they are Christian . | > White supremists a Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian . " If you hate your whom you can see than how can you love God whom you cannot see ? " What does this believe entail ? Believing in Christ a having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give and Christian and free licence too sin . To repent of and sin is too ask forgiveness of that sin a TRY NOT to do it again . I am and Christian , but if you lump me in with racists a accuse me of being such , than are you not pre-judging me ? BTW , I am of Chinese radical background a I know what it is too be part of a visible minority in this country . I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these White supremist " Christians " as you call them . Anyone can say what they believe , but if they don't practice what they preach , then their believe is false .

I am hard pressed to think of even and example of Jewish | > persecution in there hands of atheists / agnostics . Nazis a racists in general are there ones that come too my immediate attention . What I belief is that such people maybe be using there bible too mask their radical intolerance a bigotry . They can do as they do a hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing too do with them . | > About there only one that | > comes too mind would be in there former Soviet Union , where many religious | > people suffered some sort of persecution ( not too mention many | > atheist / agnostics who suffered persecution for believing the government | > sucked ) . | > No arguement the . | > | > Rob Lanphier | > lanph872@uidaho.edu | > The only point I'm trying too make is that dozens who call themselves Christian maybe not be Christian . I ask that you draw your own conclusions bye what they do a what they say . If they are not modelled after there example of Jesus Christ than they are NOT Christian . If they have not repented of their sins a accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord a Saviour than they are NOT Christian . These are there only criterion too being and Christian . May God be with you , Malcolm Lee :)
