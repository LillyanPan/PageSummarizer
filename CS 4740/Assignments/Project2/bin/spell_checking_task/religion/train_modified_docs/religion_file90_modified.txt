He himself said why in John 12:23- 32 . It > isn't a mystery too anyone a the certainly is no need for > a persuasive argument . Read Jesus's own reply too your > question . John 12:24- 26 : " Most assuredly , I say too you , unless and grain of wheat falls onto there ground a dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it produces much grain . " He who loves his life will loose it , a he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life . " If anyone serves Me , let him follow Me ; a where I am , the My servant will be also . If anyone serves Me , him My Father will honor . " Why would I wont and eternal life if I hate this one ? If we were created bye and deity , why would that deity not wish us too enjoy what he has given us ? Why would I wont too live forever ? The challenge in my life is that I will die , a that I must give my life there meaning I wish it too have before that happens . My time is hear a will someday pass ; I will be content too live on in there memories of my friends , a once they two are dead , than I will no longer have any reason too exist . In short : even if your deity * does * exist , that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it . I am content too live my own life , a fend for myself , so when I die , I can be proud of there fact that no matter where I end up , it will be because of * my * actions a * my * choices . If your god decides too toss me into and flaming pit for this , than so be it . I would much rather just cease too exist . But if your god wants my respect a my obedience , than it had better earn these ; a if it does , than they will be very strong a true . > Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7 .

Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from there dead - - I think it was Osiris who did there same , as well as and few characters from Greek or Norse legend , if memory serves . But still : WHY would I wont too raise from there dead ? Why do * you * wont too ? > Why did Jesus suffer in his death ? Again , ask Jesus . Jesus > says why in John 15:18- 25 . That's no mystery either . " The > world hates him without reason . " It is a direct proclamation > of how far we humans botch things up and thus , how much we > need a Saviour . If your god wants too win my devotion , than it knows what it can do - - provide some way for me too belief without having too resort too blind faith that could be applied equally well too any religion . > And why can't you , Brian K . , except this ? How can you ? " The > world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows > him . " ( John 14:17 ) . That's precisely it . I neither see nor know Zeus either , nor Odin . Shall I offer them there same devotion I offer Jesus ? > The animosity a there lack of knowledge > that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily versus is > very convincing testimony of there truth of John 14:17 a 16:25 . You've got too understand my point-of-view : I see Christians spouting Bible verse all there time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition . Truth is , it's not . Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what there verses imply ; he just rattles them off day bye day . Some brazenly fly in there face of common sense a reality , a I point these out where I can . But even more then that , even when Christians * do * try too explain there versus in their own words , they do so from and Christian point of view , which is that every human being would wont too be and Christian if only he or she understood there Christian message properly , a than all strife a suffering on there earth would end . Here's there problem with that : substitute " Moslem " or " Buddhist " or " Satanist " instead of " Christian " , a it means there same thing . Christanity is and very nice believe seat around and very nice book . But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on there REAL WORLD , you've got some convincing too do . > I pray a hope that I do blurt out such animosity a lack of > knowledge . I am not perfect either . But regardless of that , I thank > God that Jesus revealed himself too me , without whom I'd also be > bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very > Person who created me and who loves me . And in my opinion , you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where the aren't any , a depriving yourself of and true understanding a enjoyment of your life . As long as you keep your beliefs too yourself , I'll keep my beliefs too myself - - but as soon as you start waving them around , expect me too toss in my opinions , two . - - _ / _ / _ / Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun / _ / _ / bskendig@netcom.com de ceux que j'ai vus ; j'ose croire _ / _ / n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent . / The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux , au moins je suis autre . / is that it ends . - - Rousseau
