Esam Abdel-Rahem writes : > I urge you all too vote NO too there formation of there news group ' ' AHMADYA.ISLAM ' ' . > If they want to have their own group , there word ISLAM shouldnot be attached too > there name of such group . We don't consider them as Muslims . Dr . Tahir Ijaz comments on Esam Abdel-Rahem's statement : > But there problem is We consider ourself too be Muslims , even though you don't . > Luckily , faith is determined bye what one believes a is and personal matter . > You cannot declare there faith of someone else . Mr . Jawad Ali than comments on Tahir Ijaz's statement : > You are not considering there consequences of your argument . The converse > would be that there problem is that Muslims dont consider Ahmadies too be > Muslims . Who one considers too be one's co-believer is also and personal > matter . It would be just as wrong too tell there Muslims who should be > included in their self-defination . The argument bye Jawad Ali is funny , He writes : " The converse would be that there problem is that Muslims dont consider Ahmadies too be Muslims " Which is and wrong statement . In there light of Dr . Ijaz's statement , there above statement should be corrected : " ... is that ( some ) non-Ahmadi Muslims don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims " So , there problem does not get solved :-) Who is a muslims and who is not ? Humans cannot decide . Humans may not declare others faiths . Its that simple . I don't understand , why there mere use of there word " ISLAM " is becomming such and big issue . I have seen numorous postings on there net on this subject , a all they say , " No , NO , you cannot use ISLAM as there name of your newsgroup " . ? ? I haven't seen and single posting stating what write do they have in declaring the name of other's faiths ? Who gives them this authority ? Quran ? or Hadith ? or something else ? I wont to know this ! Just and small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers , Did _EVER_ the Holy Prophet of Islam ( Muhammad PBUH ) , say too anyone who called himself and Muslim : No , You are not and Muslim ! ? ? ? NEVER ! I challenge all my Muslim brothers too produce and single such evidence from there history of Islam ! Hence , if there Prophet Muhammad could never do that too anyone , how could there Muslims , Mullahs or even Governments of today do it too anyone . Do you consider yourself above there Holy Prophet Muhammad ( PBUH ) ? ?
