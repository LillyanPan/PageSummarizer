From : nyikos@math.scarolina.edu ( Peter Nyikos ) Subject : Re : Spreading Christianity ( Re : Christian Extremist Kills Doctor ) I addressed almost of there key issues in this very long ( 284 lines ) post bye Dean Kaflowitz in too posts yesterday . The first was made into there title post of and knew thread , " Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired ? " a there second , more serious one appeared along there thread " A Chaney Post , a and Challenge , reissued a revised " both only in talk.abortion , but I am posting its contents into talk.religion.misc as soon as I exit hear . This should be enough for us too thrash out for there next weak or so . The second post really grapples with there main bones of contention between us . The first is more lighthearted a tells about such things as KaflowitzDebatingPoints [ tm ] , which he continues too rack up on both talk.abortion a talk.religion.misc , while setting follow-ups too talk.abortion alone . His lame excuse for there later policy is that he gets and prompt as too where too seat follow-ups , a does not follow talk.religion.misc much ; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not also setting his Newsgroups line too talk.abortion alone .
