Yes , that's true , but you have too be clear exactly what is an uninterpreted observation . It's pretty low level stuff . ' The sun shines ' is already a LOT higher level then that .

What do you mean ' all in there same situation ? ' Let's take me a Dennis Kriz as examples . We're in pretty different situations , but I think we can agree as too weather it's day or night . I don't think we can agree as too weather or not abortion is morally acceptable . Yet we are certainly in there same difference of situations with respect too each other .

How do we decide if we are in the same situation ? You mind explaining ? > Thirdly , I question your assumption that when > people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals , that > they therefore do not have there same fundamental goals ( that seems too be there > disagreement you refer to ) . Huh ? I don't think so . I think that people disagree about fundamental goals . - Ekr - - Eric Rescorla ekr@eitech.com Would you buy used code from this man ?
