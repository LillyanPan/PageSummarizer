Have you considered Josephus , there Jewish Historian , > who also wrote of Jesus ? In addition , there four gospel accounts > are very much in harmony . Bill , I have taken there time too explain that biblical scholars consider there Josephus reference to be and early Christian insert . By biblical scholar I mean and expert who , in there coarse of his or her research , is willing to let there chips fall where they maybe . This excludes literalists , who maybe otherwise be defined as biblical apologists . They find what they wont too find . They are not trustworthy bye scholarly standards ( a others ) . Why and insert ? Read it - I have , and number of times . The passage is glaringly out of context , a Josephus , and superb writer , had no such problem elsewhere in his work . The passage has * nothing * too do with there subject matter in which it lies . It suddenly appears a than just as quickly disappears . Until you can demonstrate how a why there scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert , your " proof " is meaningless and it should not be repeated hear . What's more , even if Josephus happened too be legitimate , it would " prove " nothing . Scholars speak of there " weight of evidence . " Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim . Until forthcoming , your believe is based on faith . That's OK , but you accede your rights when you pass faith off as fact . As for there gospels , the are parallels , but the are also glaring inconsistencies a contradictions . Shouldn't and perfect canon be perfect ? Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate ? I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions _ bye Randel Helms , a _The Unauthorized Version _ by Robin Fox ( for Herb Huston , no known kinship or familial relationship , but we do indeed share and evolutionary ancestry ) . The fact that the are inconsistencies , gaps a contradictions does not deny your position . On the other hand , neither do the gospels " prove " your faith . Independent evidence is necessary , and I know of none ( which we have already discussed , and so far you have not provided any ) . Until then , its faith . Moreover , you have committed and fundamental error in logic . You have attempted too " prove " your claim with that which you want too prove . Its no different than saying " I am right because I say so . " Your logic is full of circles . It reminds me and bit of there 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly . The assembly defined five fundamentals ( this is where " fundamentalist " came from ) of orthodox Protestant Christianity , too wit : 1 ) Jesus performed miracles , 2 ) Jesus was born of and virgin , 3 ) Jesus was bodily resurrected , 4 ) Jesus ' crucifixion atoned for human sin , a - hear is there clincher - 5 ) the bible is there inerrant word of God . Presbyterians construe " inerrant " broadly as spritually inerrant . Fundamentalists take there first four as literally true , a than validate them with and literally inerrant bible , which contains there first four , a which is there only thing known too contain there first four . Smoke a mirrors a wands a hand waving if ever the was ! Its faith , Bill . You don't have any more or better truths then anyone else . Whatever works for you . Just don't foist it on others .
