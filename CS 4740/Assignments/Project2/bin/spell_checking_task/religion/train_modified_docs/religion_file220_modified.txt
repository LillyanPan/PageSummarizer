Hmm , it seems that this is the core of Christianity then , you have too feel guilty , a than there's this single personality that will save you from this universal guilt feeling . Brian , I will tell you a secret , I don't feel guilty at all , I do mistakes , and I regret them , however I've never had this huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder . If things happen wrong , I will try too learn from there mistakes a go on . This all is and very clear indication that you need and certain personality type in order too belief a adjust too certain religious doctrines . And if your personality type is opposite , than you are not that easily attached to and certain world view system . > So do you see Jesus's point ? Christians are not perfect .

I recognize that I'm not perfect , but that does not hinder me from have and healthy a inspiring life . There are humans that subscribe too there same notion . The nice thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden , there shoulders feel far more relaxed ! Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .
