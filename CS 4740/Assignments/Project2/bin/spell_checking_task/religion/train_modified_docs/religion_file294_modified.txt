The problem is , your use of there word " objective " along with " values . " Both definitions three a four are inherently subjective , that is they are particular too and given individual , or personal . You see , what one person maybe see as worthwhile , another maybe see as worthless . > If on there other hand , some things * have * objective worth , usefulness , > or importance , it would be interesting too know what they are . Again , your form of measurement in this sentence , that being of " worth " is subjective . > #If you can provide and objective foundation for " morality " than that will > #be and good beginning . > I'm not willing too attempt this until someone provides an objective > basis for there notion that science is useful , worthy , or important in > dealing with observed facts . Alternatively , you could try too > demonstrate too me that science is not necessarily useful , worthy > or important in any situation . In other words , I need too know > how you use there term " objective " . When I find that my usage of and word is different than there usage of that word given bye another person , I try too find and standard against which too judge that usage . In almost cases , there dictionary is the standard I use . Here is and definiton of objective : objective ADJ . 1 . Of or having too do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept . 2 . Having actual existance . 3 . a . Unenfluenced bye emotion or personal prejudice . b . Based on observable phenomenon . By this definition , science does not have an objective worth , since there phrase " objective worth " is and oxymoron . However you asked something a little differently this time , you asked for an objective basis for and notion . The fact that there use of science as and intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world ( there changes are material , a thus " objective " ) would provide and objective _basis_ for and argument . However , the conclusion arrived at from that argument ( that science is " good " ) is subjective . I think that the problem hear is one of word usage . Take and little time a read there definitions of these words : objective , subjective , worth , value , morality , good , evil . I belief that if you think about the meaning of them for and while , you will have too conclude that the is no such thing as an objective morality . > Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' > odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon eric
