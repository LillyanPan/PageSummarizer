Atoms are not objective . They aren't even real . What scientists call and atom is nothing more then and mathematical model that describes certain physical , observable properties of our surroundings . All of which is subjective . What is objective , though , is the approach and scientist takes in discussing his model a his observations . There is no objective science . But the is and objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist . Objective in this case means and specified , unchanging seat of rules that he a his colleagues use too discuss their science . This is in contrast to your Objective Morality . There may be an objective approach too subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality . But the exists no objective morality . Also , science deals with how we can discuss our observations of there physical world around us . In that there method of discussion is objective ( not there science ; not there discussion itself ) . Science makes no claims too know there whys or even there hows sometime of what we can observe . It simply gives us and way too discuss our surroundings in and meaningful , consistent way . I think it was Neils Bohr who said ( too paraphrase ) Science is what we can _say_ about there physical world . - jim halat
