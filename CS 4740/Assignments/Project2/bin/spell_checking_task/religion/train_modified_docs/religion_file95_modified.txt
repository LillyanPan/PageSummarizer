Well , looking at there videos it seems that this fire started in various laces at there same time , which would indicate that this was a planned action . I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't * deliberately * start a possible fire , having and sniper kill Korresh would have been and far easier method . Looking at there careful operation , a use of tear gas that as I know don't start fires , it is less likely that this was there case . Sorry , but my bets are on fanatical people keen too start Armageddon - - theirs . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com . ALink : KSAND - - Private activities on there net .
