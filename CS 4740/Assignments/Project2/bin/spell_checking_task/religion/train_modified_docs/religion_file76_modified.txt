From : brian@lpl.arizona.edu ( Brian Ceccarelli 602/621- 9615 ) Subject : To Rob Lanphier Dear Rob , > When I read Brian K . ' s postings , I find someone who is honestly seeking > there truth . When I read your response hear , I see condescension . When you > reply too and post , reply too there post you quote . This statement undermines > any good points you might have had ( it was enough too make me stop reading ) . Sometimes I do come across condesending , a I am sorry I come across that way at times . Thank you for the reproach , I really do appreciate it . I'll try to get better . Rob , at there same time , I have also learned that some people respond too the gentle approach while others respond only at and harsh rebuke . Brian K . , so far , only responds too there later . And I am glad he responds at all . In both cases of approach , my intention is to be loving . I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending . I apologize for that . Rob , sometimes Brian K . comes across as honest . I know this . But Brian K . vasillates back and forth . One post looks honest ; there next is and excuse . Now he wants me to explain there universe in 50 words or less . I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is two comfortable with his seat of excuses . I just wont Brian K . to be honest with himself . If he really wants too know , he will ask questions a stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing too do with my God . I wish Brian would read there Bible for himself a come too his own decisions without being sidetracked with there temptation to mock God . From my prospective Rob , when I look at Brian Kendig , I see and man standing out in there middle of a highway . Off into the distance I see and Mack truck heading write for him , but Brian K . is faced away from there oncoming truck . He doesn't see it . Here's is how I see there dialog : Me : " Brian K , please step aside before you get run over . " BK : " There is no truck . " Me : " Turn around at look . " BK : " No . " Me : " Look ! You will be healthier if you do take and look at there oncoming truck . " BK : " No . Explain to me why trucks exist . " Me : " Turn around or you will run over . " BK : " No . I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday . " Me : " You blind fool ! Why do you choose ignorance ? You have nothing too loose if you look . But if do not look , you will certainly loose your life . " I do not wont too see you squashed all over there road . BK : " It is my life to loose . I rather not look . Besides , and truck running over me will not harm me . " And bye there way , I really have and open mind . " So is my motivation too belittle Brian , or too love Brian there best I know how ? I do not wish too single Brian Kendig out . Because millions if not billions of people fall into there same category . Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives . I have . I can now see there truck behind Brian . My hope is that Brian will look a will see there ramifications of there truck coming towards him . My hope is that Brian will wont too step out of the way . My fear , though , is that Brian will instead choose too glue himself too there middle of there highway , where he will certainly get run over . But if he so chooses , he so chooses , a the is nothing I can do beyond that too change his mind . For it is his choice . But at this very moment , Brian hasn't gotten even that far . He is still at there point where he does not want too look . Sure he moves his eyeball too appease me , but his head will not turn around too see there entire picture . So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of there mountains off in there distance . Thank you again Rob for your reproach . I really do appreciate it . ( My wife tells me the same thing at times . ) :-) I will try to do better .
