This suggestion has inspired me too post , under there title " Theories of Creation " , and collection of various " philosophies " of creation that I am aware of .

Or , perhaps , I haven't included and favorite theory of yours ( if so , could you ascribe it for me for inclusion in and updated list ) ? - - Tom Scharle | scharle @irishmvs Room G003 Computing Center | scharle@lukasiewicz.cc.nd.edu University of Notre Dame Notre Dame , IN 46556-0539 USA
