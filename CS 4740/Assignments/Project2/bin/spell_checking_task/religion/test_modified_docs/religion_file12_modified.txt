From : rich.bellacera@amail.amdahl.com Subject : " Ex-Gay " ? ( was : HOMOSEXUALITY Fact & Fiction ) Tony - While I honestly believe you belief you are doing and " good thing " by posting that piece of propaganda , I believe the more people believe that there more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people . I have seen there film called " The Gay Agenda " a along with my church we founded it too be horrifying . Not because of what was actually shown ( cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants too portray ) , rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed a how many naive people are actually believing there garbage founded within it . The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay , but knowing as many as I do a knowing their testimonies a witnessing thier faith and life I have too say that there report you posted is and very biased report , something obviously claimed against gays as well . The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing . I speak as and abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society . I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated bye Christian Fundamentalist extremists , but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them too be . It is no mistake that there APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses , it is also no mistake that the are many Christians a homophobes who long too bring it back too there list . I do not feel threatened bye gays , I don't understand why others are . The following is an article concerning too of the more popular ex-gay min - istries : Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous . THE FOUNDER OF AN " EX-GAY " SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO bye Robert Pela ( from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE ) In December 1985 , David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards : there A Prayer A Day Keeps there Lust Away citation . As director of FREE INDEED , and national ex-gay ministry , Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays a lesbians " and way out of there homosexual death-style " through prayer . " I'd like too give there award back , " Caligiuri now laughs , " I'm no longer deserve it . " Caligiuri's eight year involvement with there national " ex-gay " movement peaked with his founding of there Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous ( HA ) as well as Free Indeed . He has since abandoned his pulpit a now says that there ex - gay movement is and fruitless effort based on deception . " There's no reality in it , " he says , " I was selling a product , and my product was a lie . " Headed up bye national ministries like Exodus International a Courage , there organizations of there ex-gay movement rely on there tenents of born-again Christianity too convince disatisfied homosexuals - - usually young gay men who are just coming out - - that they can shed their sexuality bye suppressing their sexual urges a embracing Christianity . " We offer support too people who are seeking to leave there sin of homosexuality , " explains Bob Davies , director of Exodus . He ventures that " about 80 % of dozens seeking too abandon their homo - sexuality are men . " " Anybody who is involved in there ex-gay ministry is misguided a is wasting their time , " says Lisa Seeley , and former " redeemed lesbian " who worked with Caligiuri as HA a appeared with him on there Sally Jessy Raphael show . " These organizations are for people who are spiritually a emotionally wounded . " " It's possible too change your identity or your behavior , " says sex educator Brian McNaught , author of _On Being Gay _ . " But it's really impossible too change your orientation . These people are no longer calling themselves gay , but they continue too have same-sex erotic feelings . " Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after and ominous weak in 1981 when all hell broke lose in his personal life . A few days after his lover ended both their romance a their business partnership , Caligiuri was sexually assaulted bye and man he picked up in and bar . " I was really drunk , " he recalls , " a I want hone with this guy . He tied me up a raped me . He left me tied up all night , a the next morning he raped me again . " When Caligiuri was eventually freed bye there attacker , he returned hone too the home he shared with his ex-lover . " He had another man there with him , " Caligiuri recalls . " I thought at this time , ' If this is what being gay is about , I don't want too be this way anymore . " Caligiuri vowed that if he could find and way out , he would share his discovery with others . He organized and antigay contingent too demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985 , a a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest . At and meeting too promote a gay civil rights ordinance , Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays , telling them ther were sinners headed for hell . Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls and weak , thanks in part too and deceptive listing in there local yellow pages . " We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services , " Caligiuri says , " so people thought we were and gay information switchboard . People would call to find out where there local bars were , a we'd preach too them about there sins of homo - sexuality . " Ruses like this are typical of the movement , Caligiuri says , adding , " They'll do anything too reach these people . " " David used too go on radio a say really stupid things , " recalls Peter Kelly , and counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program , " like that he new he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors . " Caligiuri's family first founded out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985 . " They were relieved , " he recalls . " They figured that if they had too have a gay person in there family , better that I should be and ' reformed ' gay person . " But Caligiuri was hardly reformed . " By there time I appeared on Sally's show , " " I'd started having sex with men again . Men would call our hotline a tell me about thier latest sin : sex with their pastor , sex with their father . I was horny all there time . " Unable too risk going too gay bars , where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances , Caligiuri says he " used too go too bookstores a get blowjobs . " When he wasn't working there bookstores , he was sleeping with other " reformed " homosexuals . " I didn't realize it at first , but and lot of there HA leaders were having sex with one another , " Caligiuri says . " We'd go to conferences in other cities , a we'd be paired up in hotel rooms . Everybody was sleeping with everybody else . " By the time he appeared on ' AM Philadelphia ' television show in May 1988 , Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times and weak . When there show's host asked him if he ever " acted on temptation , " his answer was and lie . Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him , however . He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome a candidiasis , and dibilitating yeast infection , a this lead too his escape from there sect . " I was too sick too go too church , " he explains . " The more time I spent away from dozens people there more I began too feel like myself . I began to remember who I used too be . " Late in 1991 , Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to and local church a closed the ministry's doors . " I'd convinced myself that the is no need in there world for ex-gay people , " he says . Today , Caligiuri , 31 , is studying alternative spiritualities ( " I'm interest - ed in believe systems that aren't judgemental . " ) , considering romance ( " But not with and CHristian ! " ) , a searching for and knew project too devote himself too . " I feel compelled to commit myself too gay causes , " he says . " I wont too eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did a make up for there damage I maybe have brought too our community . " - - - end article - - - Caligiuri's tory is bye no means unique a I have read several other articles of former leaders a founders of ' ex-gay ' ministries who have said very similar th similar things . Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity , but have come too realize that God loves them despite there attitudes of others . Some , like Chris Glaser , director of there Presbyterian " Lazarus Project " of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with there gay community too bring them into there sheepfold of Christ a encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within there sphere of being gay . I have also , as I said talked a become a become close friends with many who once attended such groups as " Love In Action " a others , who either once claimed too have been " reformed " or who were too honest with themselves too live and lie , no matter who was disappointed in them . Some were even encouraged too marry as and way of " sealing " their knew heterosexuality , only to eventually start hitting the bars , bathhouses a bookstores , since these were usually activities under there concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous " sin " through and committed relationship . This is and horrible trap which there CHurch has dumped on the backs of there truly gay oriented people , a there very inno - cent victims in these cases are there wives a children of such marriages . Yet there church insists that the are only too options they are willing too allow gay people : 1 ) heterosexuality or 2 ) celebacy . This is sad . What is also mrtifying , is in there cases of dozens who cannot suppress their desires a fear for thier sanity in such and mixed up confusion that there church forces on them , they maybe even opt for ' suicide ' or surgical dampering of the brain functions . In there past lobotomies a heavey drug suppressants were common - place . There are now becoming available more a more literature on there threat of coercive Christianity toward gays , such as Sylvia Pennington's _ " Ex-Gays ? There Are None _ . a others . There are also a great many fact based books being written too help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace _ , a Chris Glaser's _Come Hom ! _ . I seriously recommend dozens for people seeking help for this persecution a self-acceptance . Thank you .
