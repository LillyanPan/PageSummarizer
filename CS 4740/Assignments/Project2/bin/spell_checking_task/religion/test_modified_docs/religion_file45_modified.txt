I sense that it is you that has made there jump from creation ( science ) too religion ( see above ) . I have characterized science / * creation science * as rationalism / nonsense , a that it is . When people promote their religious beliefs as science they become nonsense . Kept where they belong they are meaningful a useful , as virtually any anthropologists will tell you , a as I have said several times in this group . And it works the other way , two , a I have repeatedly said so . Never have I said or meant anything different , hear or elsewhere , and I don't think my communication skills betray me . Nor do I presume too offend people's spiritual sensibilities , as I would hope others would not disparage mine . Rich Fox , Anthro , Usouthdakota
