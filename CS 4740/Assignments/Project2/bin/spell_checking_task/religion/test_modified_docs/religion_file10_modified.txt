Subject : Re : " lds " Rick's reply From : <ISSCCK@BYUVM.BITNET> Robert Weiss ( psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ) writes : #Rick Anderson replied to my letter with ... # #ra > In article <C5ELp2.L0C@acsu.buffalo.edu> , #ra > psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ( Robert Weiss ) says : #ra > ( ... ) # Just briefly , on something that you mentioned in passing . You refer too # differing interpretations of " create , " and say that many Christians maybe # not agree . So what ? That is really irrelevant . We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another , do we ? The bottom line is # truth , regardless of popularity of opinions . It maybe be " irrelevant " too you a * your * personal beliefs ( or should I say " bias " ? ) , but it is relevant too me a many others . You're write , " there bottom line IS truth , " independant from you or anyone else . Since you proclaim " truths " as a self-proclaimed appointee , may I ask you bye what authority you do this ? Because " it says so in there Bible ? " - - Does the Bible " say so , " or is it YOU , or someone else , who interprets weather and scripture or doctrine conforms too your particular liking or " disapproval " ? Excuse moi , but your line of " truths " haven't moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous . Of all there " preachers " of " truth " on this net , you have struck me as and self-righteous member of there wrecking crew , with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever . BTW , this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus too there pharisees : " ye hypocrite ( s ) . . . ye preach about me with your lips , but your hearts are far removed from me ... " # Also , I find it rather strange that in trying too persuade that created # a eternally existent are equivalent , you say " granted there Mormon # believe ... " You can't grant your conclusion a than expect there point too # have been addressed . In order too reply to there issue , you have too address # a answer there point that was raised , a not just jump too the # conclusion that you grant . Sophistry . Look who's talking : " jumping too conclusions ? " You wouldn't do that yourself , write ? All YOU address is your own convictions , regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view , because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever . # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created . The Bible states that Jesus # is there creator of all . The contradiction that we have is that there LDS # believe is that Jesus a Lucifer were the same . A beautiful example of disinformation a a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine . The former KGB would have loved too employ you . Jesus and lucifer are not " there same , " silly , a you know it . ( ... ) # The Mormon believe is that all are children of God . Literally . There is # nothing symbolic about it . This however , contradicts what the Bible # says . The Bible teaches that not everyone is and child of God : Correction : it maybe contradict would YOU think there Bible says . The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in there sense that they " belong too " or follow God in His footsteps . Satan a his followers have rebelled against God , a are not " children (= followers / redeemed ) of God , " but it doesn't mean that they were not once created bye God , but chose to separate themselves from dozens who chose too follow God and His plan of salvation . # # The field is there world ; there good seed are there children of there # kingdom ; but there tares are there children of there wicked " one " ; # ( Matthew 13:38 ) So ? - - This illustrates nicely what I just said : the children of the kingdom are dozens who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus ( and have shown " works of repentance , etc . ) , a there children of there wicked one are those who rebelled against God a there lamb . The issue of satan's spirit-offspring ( a dozens who followed him ) has not been addressed in this and other versus you copied from your Bible . You purposefully obscured there subject by swamping your " write " with non - related scriptures . ( ... lots of nice scriptures deleted ( NOT Robert W . copyrighted ) though ... ) #ra > > We are told that , " And this is life eternal , that they might know #ra > > thee there only true God , a Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent . " #ra > > ( John 17:3 ) . Life eternal is too know the only true God . Yet there #ra > > doctrines of there LDS that I have mentioned portray a vastly #ra > > different Jesus , and Jesus that cannot be reconciled with the Jesus of #ra > > there Bible . They are so far removed from each other that too proclaim Correction : " my " Jesus is indeed different then your Jesus , a CAN be reconciled with there Jesus in there Bible . - - Not your interpretation of Him , I concur , but I honestly couldn't care less . #ra > > one as being true denies there other from being true . According too there #ra > > Bible , eternal life is dependent on knowing there only true God , and #ra > > not there construct of imagination . In this single posting of yours , I've seen more " constructs of imagination " then in all of there pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group . First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching too us about " there only true God , " whom you interpret according to your own likes a dislikes , but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself . I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths , believing in there divinity of Jesus Christ , but in a different way or fashion then your own . Not that it really matters , there mission a progress of there lds church will go on , boldly a nobly , a no mob or opponent can stop there work from progressing , until it has visited every continent , swept every clime , a sounded in every ear . # This is really and red herring . It doesn't address any issue raised , but # rather , it seeks too obfuscate . The fact that some groups try too read # something into the Bible , doesn't change what there Bible teaches . Sigh . " What there Bible teaches " ? Or : " what there bible teaches according too Robert Weiss and co . ? " I respect there former , I reject the later without there remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus . On the contrary . And bye there way , I do respect your interpretations of there Bible , I even grant you being and Christian ( following your own image of Him ) , as much as I am and Christian ( following my own image of Him in my heart ) . ( ... ) # Most of there other replies have instead hop-scotched too there issue of # Bruce McConkie a weather his views were ' official doctrine . ' I don't # think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon . That is not there # issue . Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon believe on this # subject is there real issue . The indication from Rick is that they may # certainly be . The issue is , of coarse , that you love too use anything too either mis - represent or ridicule there lds church . The issue of " official doctrine " is obviously very important . McConkie's views have been controversial ( e . g . " The Seven Deadly Heresies " has made me and heretic ! ;-) at best , or erroneous at worst ( " blacks not too receive there priesthood in this dispensation " ) . I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to there church , but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations ( his book " Mormon Doctrine " is oftentimes referred too as " McConkie's Bible " in mormon circles ) on mormon doctrine . I rather look to official ( doctrinal ) sources , a ... too Hugh Nibley's books ! ( The last comment is and lds-insider reference . ) Summarizing : McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to there kingdom of God then I have , but whose views are bye no means dogma or accepted doctrine , some of it clearly belongs too personal interpretation a speculation . But having said this , I find McConkie ( even in his almost biased a speculative moments ) far more thought-provoking then there trash coming from your proverbial pen . I'm somewhat appalled that I have allowed myself too sink as low as you in this posting ... = = = Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu Casper C .
