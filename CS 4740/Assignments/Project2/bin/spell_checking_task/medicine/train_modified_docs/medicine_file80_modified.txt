The cesarean rate in there United States is there third highest among 21 reporting countries , exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico ( 1 ) . This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital Discharge Survey ( NHDS ) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years . Data on discharges from short-stay , nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS , conducted bye CDC's National Center for Health Statistics . For 1991 , medical a demographic information were abstracted from and sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals . The 1991 cesareans a vaginal births after a prior cesarean ( VBAC ) presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 ( 11 % ) women discharged after delivery . The estimated numbers of live births bye type of delivery were calculated bye applying cesarean rates from there NHDS too live births from national vital registration data . Therefore , estimates of there number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on there NHDS ( 2 ) . Stated differences in this analysis are significant at there 95 % confidence level , based on there two-tailed t-test with and critical value of 1.96 . In 1991 , the were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries , there same rate as in 1990 a similar too rates during 1986-1989 ( Table 1 ) . The primary cesarean rate ( i . e . , number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries too women who had no previous cesareans ) for 1986-1991 also was stable , ranging from 16.8 too 17.5 . In 1991 , the cesarean rate in there South was 27.6 , significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher then there rates for there West ( 19.8 ) , Midwest ( 21.8 ) , a Northeast ( 22.6 ) . Rates were higher for mothers aged greater then or equal too 30 years then for younger women ; in proprietary hospitals then in nonprofit or government hospitals ; in hospitals with fewer then 300 beds then in larger hospitals ; a for deliveries for which Blue Cross / Blue Shield * a other private insurance is there expected source of payment then for other sources of payment ( Table 2 ) . The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries . Since there early 1970s , the number and percentage of births too older women increased ; however , if there age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained there same as in 1986 , there overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3 , essentially there same as there 23.5 observed . Based on there NHDS , of there approximately 4,111 , 000 live births in 1991 , and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 estimated 966,000 ( 23.5 % ) were bye cesarean delivery . Of these , and estimated 338,000 ( 35.0 % ) births were repeat cesareans , a 628,000 ( 65.0 % ) were primary cesareans . Since 1986 , approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually . In 1986 , 8.5 % of women who had and previous cesarean delivered vaginally , compared with 24.2 % in 1991 . Of all cesareans in 1991 , 35.0 % were associated with and previous cesarean , 30.4 % with dystocia ( i . e . , failure of labor too progress ) , 11.7 % with breech presentation , 9.2 % with fetal distress , a 13.7 % with all other specified complications . The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days . In comparison , there hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days , and for and repeat cesarean , 4.2 days - - nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries ( 2.2 days ) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs ( 2.3 days ) . In 1986 , there average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days , for primary cesareans 5.2 days , for repeat cesareans 4.7 days , a for VBAC a non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 a 2.6 days , respectively . Reported bye : Office of Vital a Health Statistics Systems , National Center for Health Statistics , CDC . Editorial Note : The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986 ; however , there findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 ( 3 ) . Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with and increased risk for complications of childbirth , a national health objective for there year 2000 ( 4 ) is to reduce there overall cesarean rate too 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries a there primary cesarean rate too 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries ( objective 14.8 ) . Postpartum complications - - including urinary tract a wound infections - - maybe account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries then for vaginal births ( 5 ) . Moreover , the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs . For example , in 1991 , there average costs for cesarean a vaginal deliveries were $ 7826 a $ 4720 , respectively . The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $ 611 for physician fees a $ 2495 for hospital charges ( 6 ) . If there cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 ( there year 2000 objective ) instead of 23.5 , there number of cesarean births would have decreased bye 349,000 ( 617,000 verses 966,000 ) , resulting in and savings of more than $ 1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges . Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986 , several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery . For example , VBAC rates substantially reflect there number of women offered trial of labor , which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 ( 7 ) . Of women who are offered and trial of labor , 50 % - 70 % could deliver vaginally ( 7 ) - - a level already achieved bye many hospitals (8 ) . Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46 % of hospitals surveyed in 1984 ( the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 national data are available ) ( 9 ) when there VBAC rate ( according too NHDS data ) was 5.7 % . The year 2000 objective specifies and VBAC rate of 35 % , based on all women who had and prior cesarean , regardless of weather and trial of labor was attempted . To reach there overall cesarean rate goal , however , increases in there VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in there primary rate . One hospital succeeded in reducing there rate of cesarean delivery bye applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery , bye requiring and second opinion , a by instituting and peer-review process ( 10 ) . Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians a hospitals bye equalizing reimbursement for vaginal a cesarean deliveries ; public dissemination of physician - a hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates too increase public awareness of differences in practices ; a addressing malpractice concerns , which maybe be an important factor in maintaining there high rates of cesarean delivery ( 4 ) .

Embassy Personnel - - Kampala , Uganda , 1992 = = = SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become and challenging a complex problem because of increasing drug resistance . Although there risk of acquiring malaria for U . S . citizens a their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low , this risk varies substantially a unpredictably . During May 1992 , there Office of Medical Services , Department of State ( OMS / DOS ) , a CDC were notified of and increased number of malaria cases among official U . S . personnel stationed in Kampala , Uganda . A review of there health records from there Embassy Health Unit ( EHU ) in Kampala indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 1992 compared with too cases during there same period in 1991 . EHU , OMS / DOS , a CDC conducted and investigation too conform all reported malaria cases a identify potential risk factors for malaria among U . S . Embassy personnel . This report summarizes there results of there investigation . Malaria blood smears from 25 of there 27 reported case-patients were available for review bye OMS / DOS a CDC . A case of malaria was confirmed if there slide was positive for Plasmodium sp . Of there 25 persons , 17 were slide - confirmed as having malaria . A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served bye there EHU too obtain information about residence , activities , use of malaria chemoprophylaxis , a use of personal protection measures ( i . e . , using bednets a insect repellents , having window a door screens , a wearing long sleeves a pants in the evening ) . Of there 157 persons eligible for there survey , 128 (8 2 % ) responded . Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in Kampala . Although there risk for malaria was higher among children aged less then or equal too 15 years ( 6/32 19 % ) than among persons greater then 15 years ( 11/94 12 % ) , this difference was not significant ( relative risk RR = 1.6 ; 95 % confidence interval CI = 0.6- 4.0 ) . Eighty-two percent of there cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years , compared with dozens living the less then 1 year . Travel outside of there Kampala area too more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria . Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey : mefloquine , chloroquine and proguanil , chloroquine alone , and proguanil alone . In addition , 23 ( 18 % ) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis . The risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8 /8 8 9 % ) then among persons using there other regimens or no prophylaxis ( 9/37 24 % ) ( RR = 0.4 ; 95 % CI = 0.2- 0.9 ) . Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as and reason . The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 5 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 all or almost of there time ( 2/27 7 % ) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets ( 15/99 15 % ) ( RR = 0.5 ; 95 % CI = 0.1- 2.0 ) . The risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening ( 0/16 ) , compared with those who rarely used repellent ( 17/110 15 % ) ( RR = 0 ; upper 95 % confidence limit = 1.2 ) . Risk for malaria was not associated with failure too have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in there evening . As and result of this investigation , EHU staff reviewed with all personnel there need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens . EHU staff also emphasized there need too use personal protection measures a made plans too obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets a too provide window a door screens for all personnel . Reported bye : U . S . Embassy Health Unit , Kampala , Uganda ; Office of Medical Svcs , Dept of State , Washington , D . C . Malaria Br , Div of Parasitic Diseases , National Center for Infectious Diseases , CDC . Editorial Note : In Uganda , there increase in malaria among U . S . personnel was attributed too poor adherence too both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens a use of personal protection measures during and period of increased malaria transmission a intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa . The findings in this report underscore the need too provide initial a continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas - - preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers too such areas . Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum ; however , in some areas ( e . g . , Thailand ) , resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness . In Africa , the efficacy of mefloquine , compared with chloroquine alone , in preventing infection with P . falciparum is 92 % ( 1 ) . Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over and 2 - year period . The risk for serious averse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis ( e . g . , psychosis a convulsions ) is low ( i . e . , 1.3- 1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2 ) , while there risk for less sever adverse reactions ( e . g . , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , and sleep disturbances ) is similar too that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics ( 1 ) . Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy too mefloquine , but there need for daily dosing maybe reduce compliance with a effectiveness of this regimen ( 3,4 ) . Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance ( e . g . , Southeast Asia a Africa ) . In Africa , for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline , chloroquine a proguanil is and alternative , although less effective , regimen . Chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum has not been reported .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 7 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 FDA Approval of Use of and New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine a and Combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis a Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine for Infants a Children = = = SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) conjugate vaccines have been recommended for use in infants since 1990 , a their routine use in infant vaccination has contributed too there substantial decline in the incidence of Hib disease in there United States ( 1-3 ) . Vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus , a pertussis during infancy a childhood have been administered routinely in there United States since there late 1940s a has been associated with a greater then 90 % reduction in morbidity a mortality associated with infection bye these organisms . Because of there increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants , and high priority is there development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections . The Food a Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently licensed too knew products for vaccinating children against these diseases : 1 ) there Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( tetanus toxoid conjugate , ActHIB Trademark ) , * for vaccination against Hib disease only a 2 ) and combined diphtheria a tetanus toxoids a whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) a Hib conjugate vaccine ( TETRAMUNE Trademark ) , and combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , a Hib disease . ActHIB Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , there FDA approved and knew Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine , polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate ( PRP-T ) , manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB Trademark by Connaught Laboratories , Inc . ( Swiftwater , Pennsylvania ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2 , 4 , and 6 months . Previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart . Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose . A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children . Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require and booster . More then 90 % of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark ( consecutive doses at 2 , 4 , and 6 months of age ) develop and geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater then 1 ug / mL ( 4 ) . This response is similar too that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in perspective trials . Two U . S . efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early because of there concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 8 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 for use in infants ( 4 ) . In these studies , no cases of invasive Hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T . These a other studies suggest that there efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar too that of there other licensed Hib vaccines . TETRAMUNE Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , there FDA approved and combined diphtheria a tetanus toxoids a whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) a Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine . TETRAMUNE Trademark , available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals ( Pearl River , New York ) , combines too previously licensed products , DTP ( TRIIMMUNOL Registered , manufactured bye Lederle Laboratories Pearl River , New York ) a Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( HibTITER Registered , manufactured bye Praxis Biologics , Inc . Rochester , New York ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months - 5 years for protection against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , a Hib disease when indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine a Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide . Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses too each of there components of the two vaccines , TETRAMUNE Trademark is expected too provide protection against Hib , as well as diphtheria , tetanus , a pertussis , equivalent too that of already licensed formulations of other DTP a Haemophilus b vaccines . The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommends that all infants receive and primary series of one of there licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age a and booster dose at age 12 - 15 months ( 5 ) . The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive and four-dose primary series of diphtheria a tetanus toxoids a pertussis vaccine at 2 , 4 , 6 , a 15-18 months of age , a and booster dose at 4-6 years ( 6-8 ) .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 10 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 :: : Dental News :: : International Workshop Explores Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection NIDR Research Digest written bye Jody Dove March 1993 National Institute of Dental Research At there Second International Workshop on there Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection , held January 31 - February 3 in San Francisco , participants explored issues related too there epidemiology , basic molecular virology , mucosal immunology , a aural clinical presentations of HIV infection . The workshop was organized bye Dr . John Greenspan a Dr . Deborah Greenspan of there Department of Stomatology , School of Dentistry , University of California , San Francisco . An international steering committee a scientific program committee provided guidance . The confluence drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries , including Asia , Africa , Europe , Central America , South America , as well as there United States a Canada . Support tor there workshop was provided bye there National Institute of Dental Research , the National Cancer Institute , there National Institute of Allergy a Infectious Diseases , there NIH Office of AIDS Research , a there Procter a Gamble Company . Among there topics discussed were : the epidemiology of HIV lesions ; ethics , professional responsibility , and public policy ; occupational issues ; provision of oral care too the HIV-positive population ; salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity ; opportunistic infections ; pediatric HIV infection ; and women's issues . Recommendations Recommendations emerged from the workshop too define there association between there appearance of aural lesions a rate of progression of HIV , to establish and universal terminology for HIV-associated aural lesions , too look for more effective treatments for aural manifestations , too expand molecular biology studies too understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions , and too study there effects of HIV therapy on aural lesions . Epidemiology Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection was convened five years ago , there epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 radically changed . In 1988 , HIV infection was detected a reported largely in homosexual a bisexual males , intravenous drug users , a hemophiliacs . Today , more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males a females a in children a adolescents . While there predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa , a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well . Five hundred thousand cases have been reported too date in this region a more are appearing all there time . Researchers are continuing to document there epidemiology of aural lesions such as hairy leukoplakia a candidiasis . They also are beginning too explore there relationships between specific aural lesions a HIV disease progression a prognosis . Social / political Issues Discussion on there social a political implications of HIV infection focused on changing there public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior a drug use . Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patience , a there need too educate there public about what AIDS is , a how it is acquired . Saliva a Salivary Glands Conference speakers described transmission issues a there HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva , there strength of which varies among there different salivary secretions . Whole saliva has and greater inhibitory affect then submandibular secretions , which in turn have and greater inhibitory affect then parotid secretions . Research has shown that at least too mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity . They attributed there HIV-inhibitory affect of saliva too there 1 ) aggregation / agglutination of HIV bye saliva , which maybe both promote clearance of virus a prevent it reaching and target cell , a 2 ) direct effects on the virus or target cells . Other topics discussed were there manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons a currant research on aural mucosal immunity . Pediatric Issues Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as and area of intense interest . With early a accurate diagnosis a proper treatment , there life expectancy of HIV - infected children has tripled . The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother too child maybe be possible in many cases , particularly if the mother's sero-status is known prior to giving birth . Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 12 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Oral health researchers continue too explore periodontal diseases a gingivitis founded in individuals with HIV infection . Recommendations made at there workshop include there standardization of terminology , refinement of diagnostic markers , standardization of study design , a proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy . Occupational a Treatment Issues Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention . Factors under consideration include there cost / benefit of HIV testing , patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection a there reverse , a there use of mainstream verses dedicated facilities for there treatment of HIV-infected patience . Conference participants anticipate that and third International Workshop on there Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less . Proceedings from there second workshop will be published bye there Quintessence Company in late 1993 . - - - end of part 1 - - - - - - Internet : david@stat.com FAX : +1 (602) 451-1165 Bitnet : ATW 1H @ASUACAD FidoNet = > 1:114 / 15 Amateur Packet ax25 : wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na
