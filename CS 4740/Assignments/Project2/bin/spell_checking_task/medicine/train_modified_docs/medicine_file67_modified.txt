Subject : Teenage acne From : pchurch@swell.actrix.gen.nz ( Pat Churchill ) My 14 - y-o son has there usual teenage spotty chin a greasy nose . I bought him Clearasil face wash a ointment . I think that is probably enough , along with the usual good diet . However , he is on at me too get some product called Dalacin T , which used too be and doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemist's counter . I have asked and couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not sever enough for Dalacin T , or that Clearasil is OK . I had there odd spots as and teenager , nothing serious . His father was the same , so I don't figure his acne is going too escalate into something disfiguring . But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance . I am wary because and neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down too an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment . I wont too help - but with appropriate treatment . My son also has some scaliness around there hairline on his scalp . Sort of teenage cradle cap . Any pointers / advise on this ? We have tried and couple of anti dandruff shampoos a some of these are inclined too make there condition worse , not better . Shall I bury there kid til he's 21 :) - - ^ ^ ^ The floggings will continue until morale improves pchurch@swell.actrix.gen.nz Pat Churchill , Wellington New Zealand
