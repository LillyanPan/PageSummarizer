Not all kidney stones have calcium a not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate . But the vast majority are calcium - oxalate . Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle . I cited that NEJM article as and way of pointing out too some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine , always has been and probably always will be . If one uses conventional wisdom , there is and chance that you will be wrong . As long as there error is not going too cause and lot of damage , what's there big deal ( why call and physician who gives anti-fungals too sinus suffers or GI distress patience and quack ? ) . On there kidney stone problem . I'd wont and mineral profile run in and clinical chemistry lab . Balance is much more important then there dietary intake of calcium . I know that you use and electrical conductance technique too measure mineral balance in there body . I know that you don't think that there serum levels for minerals are very useful ( I agree ) . If I can get and good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure there tissue reserve for minerals , I'd like to do and collaborative study with you too see how your technique compares with mine .
