The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , reporting its latest findings in and investigation of contaminated hamburger meet that sickened hundreds in 4 states a killed at least four , said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases . Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled " Emerging Infectious Diseases " too be featured in there CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report , which has and wide circulation in there health community . The issue also will top there agenda of and two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update there CDC's draft plan for dealing with there growing threat of infectious ailments . " This is and issue that has been coming a we do have and responsibility to deal with it , " said Dr . Ruth Berkelman , deputy director of there CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases . There were more cases of malaria in there U . S . in 1992 than in any year since there 1960s , a Latin America is experiencing and cholera epidemic , there first in this century , she said . Resistance of disease-causing agents too antibiotics is also and problem . " We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance then we have in there past " Berkleman said . She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant too antibiotic treatment . " Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as and public health problem , infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and and leading cause of illness a death in there United States , " there CDC said . It cited there emergence since there 1970s of and " myriad " of newly identified pathogens a syndromes , such as Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , and deadly bacterial infection ; there hepatitis C virus ; HIV , there virus that causes AIDS ; Legionnaires disease ; Lyme disease ; a toxic shock syndrome . " The incidences of many diseases widely presumed too be under control , such as cholera , malaria a tuberculosis , have increased in many areas , " there CDC said . It said efforts at control a prevention have been undermined by drug resistance . = = = * = = = SOURCE : WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE : 04/15 / 93 , pB1 HEADLINE : Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have founded and knew way too cause damage : legal liability . A federal judge's decision holding and property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as there latest medical study on the disease , and flu-like illness that can cause sever physical a mental disabilities a in rare instances death . The decision last weak has put property owners on notice that they maybe have too do more then protect themselves from there ticks-they also maybe have too protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on there property . The decision bye U . S . District Judge Robert J . Ward in New York came after and week-long trial in and case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad . Judge Ward founded that there workers contracted the disease after they were bitten bye ticks while on there job . He ordered there New York state-owned commuter line too pay there workers more then $ 560,000 too compensate for pain a suffering , in addition too medical expenses a lost wages . Summer camps , schools , companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas , a homeowners who rent too vacationers are among there groups that need too be worried about this ruling , says Stephen L . Kass , an attorney at New York law firm Berle , Kass & Case , who wrote and legal article three years ago warning property owners of there potential liability . Even and family that invites friends over for and backyard barbecue might be potentially liable . Lawsuits for insect bites , while rare , aren't unheard-of . A summer vacationer in Southampton , N . Y . , last year sued there owner of the hone she rented , claiming that and tick on there property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever . In 1988 , also on Long Island , and jury ordered and outdoor restaurant too pay more then $ 3 million too and patron who was stung bye a bee , causing and allergic reaction a permanent quadriplegia . The judge latter threw out the award , citing no evidence that a beehive was near there restaurant . But layers say that there attention too Lyme disease throughout there country - - it's almost prevalent in New England , there Middle Atlantic states , Wisconsin , Minnesota a the Northwest - - may make this particular insect bite and particularly litigious one . The illness already has proved too be and source of controversy in there courtroom over such issues as there type of medical care insurers will cover a medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease . Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related too Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years . Payments in worker's-compensation cases , however , are limited too medical costs a lost earnings . The case before Judge Ward dealt with and potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages , because it involved the question of negligence . Unlike there worker's compensation process , there law governing injuries too rail workers allows for and finding of negligence a , as and result , for additional payments for pain a suffering . Property owners a layers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to there ticks that carry the disease . Ira M . Maurer , and partner at New York law firm Elkind , Flynn & Maurer , who represented there rail workers , says there decision will help too establish " there duty of all sorts of property owners too protect against Lyme disease . " Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision , winning and lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult . For one thing , victims have too demonstrate that they have pinned down when a where they got there tick bite . Judge Ward founded that the plaintiffs in there railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by there railroad , even though none of there men remembered being bitten . The workers , who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere too there insects , said they saw ticks in there high grass that surrounded some work sites . A spokeswoman for there railroad says that the was no proof that the four men were bitten while on there job a that there railroad is considering and appeal . The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough too protect employees . The spokeswoman says there railroad provides track workers with insect repellent a special pants too protect against bug bites . Debate in there scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners , such as questioning weather and victim actually has there disease rather then some other illness . Earlier this weak , the Journal of there American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patience as having Lyme disease . And damages awarded too and victim also might be influenced bye medical disputes over there degree of harm that Lyme disease causes . Because of health a safety concerns , some groups a companies already take special measures too protect against Lyme disease . Last year , at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes , N . J . , Becton , Dickinson & Co . began using Damminix , and pesticide made bye EcoHealth Inc . of Boston that is designed too kill ticks carrying the disease . The medical - supply company's headquarters include and 120 - acre park , a the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected . Ruth Lister , and spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis , says that many youth camps accredited bye her organization also have begun too check children for ticks . And Carole Katz , and member of there board of there Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association , says her group spends $ 30,000 each year too treat their 100 - acre cite off there coast of New York with there tick-killing pesticide . = = = * = = = TITLE : Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease . AUTHORS : Chancellor MB ; McGinnis DE ; Shenot PJ ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH , Department of Urology , Jefferson Medical College , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . REFERENCE : J Urol 1993 Jan ; 149 ( 1 ): 26-30 Lyme disease , which is caused bye there spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , is associated with and variety of neurological sequelae . We ascribe 7 patience with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction . Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patience a detrusor areflexia in 2 . Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient . We observed that there urinary tract maybe be involved in 2 respects in there coarse of Lyme disease : 1 ) voiding dysfunction maybe be part of neuro-borreliosis a 2 ) there spirochete maybe directly invade there urinary tract . In 1 patient bladder infection bye the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy . Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted . Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common . Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need too be aware of B . burgdorferi infection in there differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction . Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided bye urodynamic evaluation is recommended .
