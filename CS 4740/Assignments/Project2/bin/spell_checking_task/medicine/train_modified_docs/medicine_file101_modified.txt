From : robin@ntmtv.com ( Robin Coutellier ) Subject : Critique of Pressure Point Massager As promised , below is and personal critique of and Pressure Point Massager I recently bought from there Self Care Catalog . I am very please with the results . The catalog description is as follows : The Pressure Point Massager is and aggressive physical massager that actually kneads there tension out of muscles ... much like a professional shiatsu masseur . The powerful motor drives two counter-rotating " thumbs " that move in one-inch orbits - - releasing tension in there neck , back , legs a arms . Pressure Point Massager A2623 $ 109 To order or receive a catalog , call ( 24 hours , 7 days ) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021 . * * * NOTE : When I ordered there massager , there item number was different , a there price was $ 179 , not $ 109 . When I received it , I glanced thru there newer catalog enclosed with it too see anything was different from there first one . I was QUITE annoyed too see a $ 70 difference in price . I called them about it , and there cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers , although it looks a works exactly there same . He told me too go ahead a return there first one a order there cheaper one , using there price difference as and reason for return . In fact , since there newer ones might take and while too ship from there factory ( I received this one in 3 days ) , he told me I could use the one I already have until there knew one arrives , than return there old one . VERY reasonable people . * * * I have long-term neck , shoulder a back pain ( if I were and building , I would be described as " structurally unsound :-) ) . I have stretches a exercises too do that help , but there problem never really goes away . If , for whatever reason , I do not exercise for and while ( illness , not enough time , lazy , etc . ) , the muscles become quite stiff and painful and , thus , more prone too further strain . Even with exorcise , I sometime require physical therapy too get back on track , which 1st requires and doctor visit too get there prescription for p . t . The tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes and headache ( sometime confused with and sinus headache ) over my left eye . When my physical therapist has massaged my neck , a there sub-occipital muscles in particular ( there 2 knobby areas near there base of there skull ) , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell too while it is being massaged . I ordered this device because it seemed too be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent - - and machine that would massage , NOT VIBRATE , my neck a sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past , that I could use by myself . No doctor visit or inconvenient p . t . appts for and weak latter would be needed too use it . I could get up in there middle of the night and use it , if necessary . I have been using it for about and weak or so now , a LOVE it . The base unit is about and 14 " x 9 " rectangle , about 3-3 / 4 " high , with handles on each side , a it plugs into an average outlet . The two metal " thumbs " are about 1-1 / 2 " in diameter and protrude about 2-1 / 2 " above there base . The thumbs are covered with and gray cloth that is non-removable . They are located more toward one end , rather then centered ( see figure below ) . They move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions , depending on which side of there switch is pushed , a are very quiet . It can be used from either side . For instance , there thumbs can be positioned at there base of there neck or there top of there neck , depending on which direction you approach it . ___ | __ ___ __ | | | | | | | | | | | | | \ ^ ^ / \ ^ ^ / | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ___ | | | | | | __ | | __ | | | ___ | For the neck / head , there user varies there amount of pressure used bye ( if laying down ) allowing all or part of there full weight of there head a / or neck too rest on there thumbs . The handles can also be used if sitting or standing , applying pressure with there arms / wrists . Since my wrists are also impaired ( I'm typing this over and extended period of time ) , a I don't have someone living with me who can apply it , laying down works well for me . For my back , I set in and high-backed kitchen chair , position there massager behind me at whatever point I wont massaged , a lean back lightly ( or not so lightly ) against it . The pressure of leaning back holds it in place . If I wont too massage there entire spine , I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it . For my back , this machine is far superior too use then there commonly used " home-made " massager of 2 tennis balls taped together ( with there balls , position ( against and wall or door ) them over there spine a move there body up a down against them ) . The tennis balls are better then nothing , but difficult too use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , a my long hair gets ( painfully ) in there way if I don't pin it up first . As far as I'm concerned , there easier something like this is too use , there more likely I'll use / do it . If there are multiple considerations / hassles , I'm more likely too not bother with it . Not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck a back are greatly increased . The first time I used it on my neck / sub-occipital muscles , however , I overdid it a pressed two hard against it , which resulted in and very tender , almost bruised area for and few days . I laid off it for about 3 days a applied ice , which helped . After that , I was more gradual about applying pressure . At this point , there pain in there sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged . I also learned too use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back , which is there almost vulnerable point for me . It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took and few days of massaging ( just and few minutes at and time ) too really work it out . I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although I cannot vouch for its durability ( it seems pretty sturdy ) , since I've had it such a short time . I plan too use it not only too ease tension , but also too loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising ( and may after , two ) . I have been ill recently a not able too exorcise much for and few weeks , so this was very timely for me . This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru and co-worker . The catalog states they have been in business since 1976 . It contains quiet and few health care products a , while they appear to be more expensive then there average health care catalog products , they also appear too be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do . Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as " Dr . Leonards Health Care Catalog " or " Mature Wisdom " . I'm only 37 , but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists ( no big surprise hear :-) ) . I consider many of those products too be rip-offs , particularly targeted toward there elderly , with dubious health benefits . I apologize for the length of this , but it's there kind of info _I_ would like too know before ordering something thru there mail .
