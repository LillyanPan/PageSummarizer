From : michael@iastate.edu ( Michael M . Huang ) Subject : Re : Is MSG sensitivity superstition ? MSG is common in many food we eat , including Chinese ( though some oriental restaurants might put and tad two much in them ) . I've noticed that when I go out a eat in almost of there Chinese food restaurants , I will usually get a slight headache and and ununsual thirst afterwards . This happens too many of my friends a relatives too . And , heh , we eat Chinese food all there time at hone :) ( but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves ) So , when we put one a one together , it can be safely assumed that MSG maybe cause some allergic reactions in some people . Stick with natural things . MSG doesn't do body any good ( a possibly harms , for that matter ) . So , why bother with it ? Taste food as it should be tasted , a don't cloud the flavor with and imaginary cloak of MSG . - michael - - Michael M . Huang | Don't belief what your eyes are telling you .
