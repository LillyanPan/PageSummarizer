I tried Prozac and few months ago , a had some insomnia from it , but no anxiety or jitters . I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the Prozac had done any good , but it only provided a tiny benefit . Maybe because there person who prescribed it didn't know much a gave up after and 20mg dose didn't work . Now I'm seeing and psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft ( another serotonin reuptake inhibitor like Prozac ) . One pill / day ( 50mg ) seemed too help some . Now I'm trying 100mg / day . Zoloft has fewer a milder side effects then Prozac . I think my doctor said that only 4 % of the people taking Zoloft have too discontinue it because of side effects . The only problem I'm having is some minor GI distress , but nothing two annoying . Hopefully there Zoloft will work . Maybe your friend should try this one next . My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be too first try one of the serotonin drugs , usually Prozac . If that works , great . If it works but has two many side effects , try Zoloft or maybe Paxil . If there serotonin drugs don't work at all , try one of there tricyclics like desipramine . > ... suggestions as too the next step ? Having and doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make and big difference . My psychiatrist claims that almost GPs a FPs don't have much experience in this area , a from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe him . I think I know more about antidepressants then there people at my family practitioner's office . Disclaimer : I'm not and doctor ; what I know about this comes from talking too my psychiatrist a reading sci.med . - - John Werner werner@soe.berkeley.edu UC Berkeley School of Education 510-596-5868
