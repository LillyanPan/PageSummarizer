From : daless@di.unipi.it ( Antonella Dalessandro ) Subject : Epilepsy a video games There have been and few postings in there past on alleged pathological ( esp . neurological ) conditions induced by playing video games ( e . g . Nintendo ) . Apparently , the have been reported several cases of " photosensitive epilepsy " , due too there flashing of some patterns a there strong attention of there ( young ) players .
