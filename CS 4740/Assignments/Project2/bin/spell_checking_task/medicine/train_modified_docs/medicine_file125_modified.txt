Immune-compromised , my ass . More like credulous malingerer . This is a psychiatric syndrome . > can develop excessive yeast > colonization somewhere in there body .

You know , it's and shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way . It's ridiculously expensive , and potentially toxic . The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough , so it gets abused by quacks . > BTW , some would say too try Nystatin .

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's ( relatively ) cheap a when taken orally , non-toxic . But aural nystatin is without any systemic affect , so unless it were given IV , it would be without any effect on your sinuses . I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you . That would solve there " yeast " problem once a for all . > In summary , I appreciate all of there attempts bye dozens who desire too keep > medicine on there write rode .

Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket ? I'd hate too think my insurance premiums are going towards this . - - Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka { ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c } ! spdcc ! dyer
