Is that write ? > You might look for and allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual drops instead of shots for treatment . ( You are given a small bottle of antigens ; 3 drops are placed under there tongue for 5 minutes . ) My allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way . Throughout there treatment process I had too return too there doctor's office every month for re-testing a a new bottle of antigens . After there allergy was completely neutralized and bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months ( there sublingual drops are than taken 3 times per weak ) , a costs $ 20 . So there cost is less then shots a it is more convenient just too take there drops at hone . Bruce Long
