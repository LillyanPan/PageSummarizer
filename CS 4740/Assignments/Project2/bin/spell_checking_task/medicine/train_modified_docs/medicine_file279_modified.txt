I have and long sighted eye a and short sighted eye . My write eye tends to cut out when I look at distant things , my left eye when I am close up . I had specs to balance things up and bit but could do without them . I thought that , one way or another , I would always be able too see clearly . Unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head a I can no longer see close up objects clearly . Maybe it's just that my arms are getting shorter :-) - - ^ ^ ^ The floggings will continue until morale improves pchurch@swell.actrix.gen.nz Pat Churchill , Wellington New Zealand :: :
