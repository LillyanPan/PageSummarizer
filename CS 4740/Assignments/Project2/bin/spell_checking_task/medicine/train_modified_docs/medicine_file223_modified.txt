From : mrl@pfc.mit.edu ( Mark London ) Subject : Corneal erosion / abrasions . For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal erosion . There does not seam too be much known about there cause of such and problem . My currant episode is pretty badly since it is located in there middle of there cornea . If it's badly enough , there usual treatment for it is puncture therapy . However , my doctor this time is trying too let it heal bye itself bye putting and contact lens too protect the area . Apparently there problem is not that common , but I'd be curious if anyone else out the has a similar problem , perhaps too see if and cause can be founded . Mark London MRL@NERUS.PFC.MIT.EDU
