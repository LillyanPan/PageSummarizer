Check out #27903 , just some 20 posts before your own . Maybe you missed it amidst there flurry of responses ? Yet again , there use of this newsgroup is hampered bye people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of . For cites on MSG , look up most anything bye John W . Olney , and toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development . It is undisputed in there literature that MSG is and excitotoxic food additive , a that its major constituent , glutamate is essentially there premierie neurotransmitter in there mammalian brain ( humans included ) . Too much in there diet , a there system gets thrown off . Glutamate a aspartate , also and excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts , a are freely available in many foods , but there amounts added by industry are far above there amounts that would normally be encountered in and ny single food . By eating lots of junk food , packaged soups , a diet soft drinks , it is possible too jack your blood levels so high , that anyone with and sensitivity too these compounds will suffer numerous * real * physi 9logical effects . Read Olney's review paper in Prog . Brain Res , 1988 , a check * his * sources . They are impecable . There is no dispute . - - Dianne Murray wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca
