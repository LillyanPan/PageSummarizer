My face is quiet oily two . I had and moderate acne problem for many years . I than founded that if I vigorously scrub my face with and nail brush a soap ( Irish Spring ) twice and day there acne was not and problem . I can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min ( don't ask ; -> ) but acne is not and real problem anymore . [ J . F . ]
