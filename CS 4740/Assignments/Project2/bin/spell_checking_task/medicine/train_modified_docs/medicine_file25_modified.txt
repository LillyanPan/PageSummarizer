From : ghilardi@urz.unibas.ch Subject : left side pains Hello too everybody , I right hear because I am kind of desperate . For about six weeks , I've been suffering on pains in my left head side , the left leg and sometimes there left arm . I made many tests ( e . g . computer tomography , negative , lyme borreliosis , negative , all electrolytes in there blood in their correct range ) , they're all o . K . , so I should be healthy . As and matter of fact , I am not feeling so . I was also at and Neurologist's two , he considered me healthy two . The blood tests have shown that I have little two much of Hemoglobin ( 17.5 , common range is 14 to 17 , I unfortunately do not know about there units ) . Could these hemi-sided pains be there result of this or of and also possible block of there neck muscles ? I have no fever , a I am not feeling entirely sick , but neither entirely healthy . Please answer bye direct email on <ghilardi@urz.unibas.ch> Thanks for every hint Nico
