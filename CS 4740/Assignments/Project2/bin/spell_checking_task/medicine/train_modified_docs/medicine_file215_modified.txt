From : candee@brtph5.bnr.ca ( Candee Ellis P8 85 ) Subject : Re : HELP for Kidney Stones ... If you think you have kidney stones or your doctor tells you that you do , DEFINITELY follow up on it . My sister was diagnosed with kidney stones 1 1/2 years ago a given medication too take to dissolve them . After that failed and she continued too be in great pain , they decided she had endometriosis . When they did exploratory surgery , they discovered she had and tumor , which turned out to be rhabdomyosarcoma - - a very rare and agressive cancer . I realize this is not what happens in the majority of cases , but you never know what can happen and shouldn't take chances !
