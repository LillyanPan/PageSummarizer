From : hoss@panix.com ( Felix there Cat ) Subject : med school admission continued . hi all , i got several emails a and couple news replies a i guess i shoulda want into more detail ... Being my anxiety level is peaking a you folks have no clue who I am I maybe as well post there specifics a see what you people think regarding my previous post . To recap i applied to 20 schools total , 16 of which were MD and 4 DO . as it stands now i have had 13 rejects , 4 interviews ( 2 MD and 2 DO ) , the results of which are 2 waiting lists ( 1 MD and one DO ) 3 schools i heard nothing from at all . I have contacted all institutions other then there rejects a they have no info whatsoever too tell me . I have taken and good mix too apply too .. 2-3 top schools and bunch of middles a and few " safety " ( funny that almost of my safety schools were there first too reject me ) my index is at like and 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ a R7 P9 B11 WR I couldnt get the damn reading score up ... i never stuff like art history , politics etc Ive done medical research at there undergrad level , done clinical lab work for years now , but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience . I cant think of what else i left out ... but thats there summary . What percent of people are usually called from there waiting lists on and average ? I felt that my interviews want quiet well yet i dont have a firm acceptance in my hand ... anyone have any suggestions as too calm the mailbox anxiety ? If you premeds out the or med students have any questions or comments for me feel free too send them down ... Typing is and form of anti-anxiety thereapy hehehehe :) - - / \ _ / \ | Felix The Cat | 0 0 | - - - \= = The Wonderful , Wonderful Cat ! \= =@ = =/ \ ___ \ | = = = Meow ! - - - \ _ - _ / | | | | hoss@panix.com
