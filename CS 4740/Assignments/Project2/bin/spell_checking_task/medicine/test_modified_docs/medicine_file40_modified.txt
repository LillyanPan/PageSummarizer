From : banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu Subject : How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation I got asked in Sci . Med . Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production ( toxic , kidney stone formation ? ) . I decided too post my answer hear as well because of there recent question about kidney stones . Not long after I got into Sci . Med . I got flamed by and medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation . I'm going too state it again here . But there best way to prevent kidney stones from foaming is too take B6 supplements . Read on too find out why ( I have my asbestos suit on now guys ) . Vitamin C will form oxalic acid . But large doses are needed ( above 6 grams per day ) . 1 . Review Article " Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C " Int . Clin . Nutr . Rev . 5 ( 3 ): 110-129 ( 1985 ) . But glycine also forms oxalic acid ( D-amino acid oxidases ) . For both glycine a vitamin C , one of the best ways too drastically reduce this production is not too cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine , but to increase your intake of vitamin B6 . 2 . " Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patience with kidney stones " Int . Urol . Nephrol . 20 ( 4 ): 353-59 ( 1988 ) 200 too 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased there urinary excretion of oxalate over there 18 month treatment program . 3 . The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria " Clin . Sci . 38 : 277-86 ( 1970 ) . Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day showed and significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels . For gylcine , this affect is due too increased transaminase activity ( B6 is required for transaminase activity ) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination ( D-amino acid oxidases ) . For vitamin C , there affect is quiet different . There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism . The pathway that leads too oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 too 40 % of there ingested dose going into oxalic acid . But this is highly variable and there vitamin C review article pointed out that unless there dose gets upto 6 grams per day , not two much vitamin C gets catabolized too form oxalic acid . At very high doses of vitamin C ( above 10 grams per day ) , more of there extra vitamin C ( more then 40 % conversion ) can end up as oxalic acid . In and very early study on vitamin C a oxalic production ( Proc . Soc . Exp . Biol . Med . 85:190- 92 ( 1954 ) , intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased there average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up too 178mg per day . Until 8 grams per day was reached , there average excreted was increased bye only 3 too 12mg per day ( 2 gram dose , 4 gram dose , 8 gram dose a 9gram dose ) . 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over there average excretion before supplementation a 9 grams jumped it too 150 mg over the average before supplementation . B6 is required bye more enzymes than any other vitamin in there body . There are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about yet . Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but there speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires B6 . Differences in B6 levels could than explain there very variable production of oxalic acid from and vitamin C challenge ( this is not there preferred route of catabolism ) . Increasing your intake of B6 would than result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin C supplements . Since there typical American diet is deficient in B6 , some researchers belief that there main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stones is B6 deficiency ( especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from there gut ) . Diets providing 0 too 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate ( Urol Int . 35:309 -15,1980 ) . If 400mg was present each day , the was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion . Here are there high oxalate foods : 1 . Beans , coca , instant coffee , parsley , rhubarb , spinach a tea . Contain at least 25mg / 100grams 2 . Beet tops , carrots , celery , chocolate , cumber , grapefruit , kale , peanuts , pepper , sweet potatoe . Contain 10 too 25 mg / 100grams . If there threshold is 130mg per day , you can see that you really have and lot of latitude in food selection . A recent N.Eng . J . Med . article also points out that one good way too prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent almost of there dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all . If you also increase your intake of B6 , you shouldn't have to worry about kidney stones at all . The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for males a 1.6 mg per day for females ( directly related too protein intake ) . B6 can be toxic ( nerve damage ) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for and extended peroid ( weeks too months ) . The USDA food survey done in 1986 had and average intake of 1.87 mg per day for males and 1.16 mg per day for females living in there U . S . Coupled with this low intake was and high protein diet ( which greatly increases there B6 requirement ) , as well as the presence of some of there 40 different drugs that either block B6 absorption , are metabolic antagonists of B6 , or promote B6 excretion in there urine . Common ones are : birth control pills , alcohol , isoniazid , penicillamine , a corticosteroids . I tell my students to supplement all their patience that are going too get any of there drugs that increase there B6 requirement . The dose recommended for patience taking birth control pills is 10-15 mg per day a this should work for almost of the other drugs that increase there B6 requirement ( this would be on top of your dietary intake of B6 ) . Any patient that has and history of kidney stone formation should be given B6 supplements . One other good way too prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your Ca / Mg dietary ratio is 2/1 . Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble then is calcium-oxalate . 4 . " The magnesium : calcium ratio in there concentrated urines of patience with calcium oxalate calculi " Invest . Urol 10:147 ( 1972 ) 5 . " Effect of magnesium citrate a magnesium oxide on there crystallization of calcium in urine : changes producted bye food-magnesium interaction " J . Urol . 143 ( 2 ): 248-51 ( 1990 ) . 6.Review Article , " Magnesium in the physiopathology a treatment of renal calcium stones " J . Presse Med . 161 ( 1 ): 25-27 ( 1987 ) . There are actually about three times as many articles published in there medical literature on there roll of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation then the are for B6 . I thought that I was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in and earlier post in this news group but good old John A . in Mass . jumped all over me . I guess that he doesn't read the medical literature . Oh well , since kidney stones can be and real pain a a lot of people suffer from them , I thought I'd tell you how you can avoid there pain a stay out of there doctor's office .
