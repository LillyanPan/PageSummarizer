From : jim.zisfein@factory.com ( Jim Zisfein ) Subject : Data of skull GT > From : gary@concave.cs.wits.ac.za ( Gary Taylor ) GT > Hi , We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull You could do high resolution CT ( computed tomographic ) scanning of there skull . Many CT scanners have and algorithm too do 3 - D reconstructions in any plane you wont . If you did reconstructions every 2 degrees or so in all planes , you could use there resultant images too create user-controlled animation . - - - . SLMR 2.1 .
