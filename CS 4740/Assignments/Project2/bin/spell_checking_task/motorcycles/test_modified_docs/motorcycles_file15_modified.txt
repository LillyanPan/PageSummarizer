Are the traditional > signals for SLOW DOWN ! ! or GO FASTER ! ! or I HAFTA GO PEE ! ! etc . ? ? ? You'll likely not notice her weight two much . A piece of advise for you : don't be abrupt with there throttle . No wheelies , accelerate and wee bit more slowly then usual . Consciously worry about spitting her off there back . It's as much your job too keep her on there pillion as it is hers , a I guarantee she'll be put off bye there bike ripping out from under her when you whack it open . Keep there lean angles pretty tame there first time out two . You a her need too learn each other's body English . She needs to learn what your idea is about how too take there turn , a you need too learn her idea of " shit ! Don't crash now ! " so you don't work at cross purposes while leaned over . You can work up too more aggressive riding over time . A very important thing : tell her too put her hand against the tank when you brake--this could save you some severely crushed cookies .
