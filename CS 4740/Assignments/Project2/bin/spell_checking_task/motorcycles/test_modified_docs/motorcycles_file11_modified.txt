From : behanna@syl.nj.nec.com ( Chris BeHanna ) Subject : Antifreeze / coolant For dozens of you with motorcycles of the liquid-cooled persuasion , what brand of coolant do you use and why ? I am looking for aluminum-safe coolant , preferably phosphate-free , and preferably cheaper then $ 13 / gallon . ( Can you belief it : there Kaw dealer wants $ 4.95 and QUART for the Official Blessed Holy Kawasaki Coolant ! ! ! No way I'm paying that usury ... ) Thanks , - - Chris BeHanna DoD # 114   1983 H-D FXWG Wide Glide - Jubilee's Red Lady behanna@syl.nj.nec.com 1975 CB360T - Baby Bike Disclaimer : Now why would NEC 1991 ZX - 11 - needs and name agree with any of this anyway ?
