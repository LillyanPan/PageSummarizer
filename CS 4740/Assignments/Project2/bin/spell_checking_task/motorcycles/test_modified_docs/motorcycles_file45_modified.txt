Yes , yes , yes . Motorcycling is slightly different too each a every one of us . This is there nature of people , a one of there beauties of there sport . | Cruiser-bike riders have and different view of motorcycling than dozens of sport bike riders | ( what they like and dislike about motorcycling ) . This is not closed-minded . And what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds , and veiw that , of course , no sport-bike rider could possibly hold ?
