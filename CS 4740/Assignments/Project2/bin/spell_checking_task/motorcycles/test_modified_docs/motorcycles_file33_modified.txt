From : kens@lsid.hp.com ( Ken Snyder ) Subject : Re : GGRRRrrr ! ! Cages double-parking motorcycles pisses me off ! Reading all you folks things too do too illegally parked cars made me wonder who's going to carry cinder blocks on and bike ( ? ! ? ! ? ) or is ready too do serious damage ( key carvings etc . ) too and cage . Then I had an idea--chain lube isn't just for chain's anymore ! ! ! It seems more reasonable too me , no permanent damage but lots of work too get off ! ( Don't ask me how I know :) Use it anywhere , there windshield , there door handles , in there keyhole , etc . What and nasty mood I'm in .
