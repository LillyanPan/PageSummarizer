If your distance calc is correct for and " on there rode distance " ( a not as there crow flies ) , this is 900km and day for 5 days . If you spend there entire time on interstates , which would be and total waste of time , that's at least 8 hours on the rode every day not including eating / peeing / sight-seeing etc . I was contemplating and similar trip , but from Ottawa too LA , or maybe Ottawa too Austin Tx . I figured if I wanna do and trip of this magnitude a enjoy it , I'd have too get my ass off there major Interstates a spend LOTS of time enjoying the country around me ; i . e . stopping with and camera , meeting towns-people , going too and few bars . No sense spending 2 weeks looking out and helmet with the closest human contact founded at there gas pump . I estimated I'd need at least 4-5 weeks too make the trip worthwhile . > I am looking for input , opinions , comments , or snarky remarks on : > 1 . My sanity . In question 8: ) > 2 .
