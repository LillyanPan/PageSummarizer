Thanks in advance for any opinions a or experiences A friend of mine ( who's probably reading this write now ) just bought and knew Yamaha Virago 750 . After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening watching him struggle with there bolts ( had to remove the right peg , loosen there break pedal , & c . & c . ) I've pretty much decided never too get this particular model unless he or someone else wants too change there oil / filter for me . Compared too there 5 - minute change he was used too for his Honda , this is just and design flaw / oversight in my eyes . Patricia phj@remus.rutgers.edu
