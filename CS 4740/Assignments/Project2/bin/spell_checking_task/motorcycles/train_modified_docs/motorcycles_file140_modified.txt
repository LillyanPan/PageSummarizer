From : max@queernet.org ( Max J . Rochlin ) Subject : Re : Speeding ticket from CHP Interesting . I'd fight there ticket . First off , there's and 50/50 chance there cop won't show up . Secondly , if he does show up , you should point out that he lied ( purgered ) on there ticket . Why 70 + ? I beleive that if yo're charged with going more than 15mph that there posted speed it's and more sever ticket . You couldn't have p [ ossibly been going 70 + , write ? ! - - | max@queernet.org | Max J . Rochlin | { uunet , sgi } ! unpc ! max | + - - - + | Protect me from what I wont ... |
