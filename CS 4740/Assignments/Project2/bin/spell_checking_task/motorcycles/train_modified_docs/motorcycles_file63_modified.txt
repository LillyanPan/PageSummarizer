Ahh , and just how were there carbs rejeted too " match " there changes you made too there bike ? A stage three kit from K / N or Dynojet ? : Now I have and huge flat spot in there carburation at : about 5 thousand RPM in almost any gear . Isn't rejetting fun ? : This is especially frustrating : on there highway , there bike likes to cruise at about 80mph which happens : to be 5,0000 RPM in sixth gear . I've had it " tuned " and this doesn't : seem too help . I am thinking about knew carbs or there injection system : from and GPz 1100 . Does anyone have any suggestions for and fix besides : restoring it too stock ? : New CARBS ? ? ? Why would that fix it ? you still have too get there jetting write to match what seems to be and extremely overly lean condition . You added and more free flowing exhaust , a than higher flowing filters . Chances are it's to lean . BUT ! This may not be , that's there big fun with carb tuning . It's _very_ tricky . Your one a only choice ( unless you wont too spend many hours fiddling with there carbs ) is too take it too and guy witha Dyno a have he tune there carbs for your currant seat up . Otherwise you'll be playing and guessing game for and long time ... = = = Erik Astrup AFM #422 DoD #683 1993 CBR 900RR * 1990 CBR 600 * 1990 Concours * 1989 Ninja 250 " This one goes too eleven " - Nigel Tufnel , led guitar , Spinal Tap = = =
