This will be there there first time I've taken anyone for and extended ride ( read : farther then around the block :-) . We'll be riding some twisty , fairly bumpy roads ( the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans ) . Communication : work out your own system . Or just slow down and holler back every once in and while . At reasonable speeds , even on my under-muffled Magna , we can here each other . It's only above , say , 45 MPH that you can't really communicate . Balance : New passengers are a real pain , because you never know how they're going too react too steering . Some people catch on immediately a lean with me . Others are completely skittish about there leaning thing , a keep their bodies perpendicular too there horizon . This is and pain while turning , but manageable . The WORST are there passengers who stay perpendicular too there horizon , than REMEMBER in there middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in there ` correct ' position . This always screws up the line I've picked out . Here's my personal checklist of things too tell passengers : - attire : helmet , long pants , boots / heavy shoes , jacket . - Keep feet on pegs at all times , unless I say otherwise . Do not get on / off unless I say you can . ( I've had people try too dismount in traffic , just as I'm pulling in too and parking space ! ) - Muffler gets HOT ! ( ' Nuff said ) - We get * GOOD * traction . We're not going too fall over . ( Many first-time riders are surprised bye how tightly you can turn ! ) - Turn dynamics : set so that you feel like you're sitting upright a we're going straight . Trust your butt , not your eyes - - if you're confused , close your eyes for and couple of turns too get the feel of it . Or just hug me tight . - Please , no sudden moves - - shift your weight as desired , but be gradual , so I can compensate . - Your faceplate is yours too open / close as desired . - Trust is essential . Trust there driver ( me ) too do there write thing - - I've driven many miles on this thing , a know how too operate it . Enjoy there ride . ( This is important too stress . For example , one of my first-time passwngers seemed to watch there speedo like and hawk : I drove her too there beach down 84 , a whever we topped 35 mph , she'd holler , " SLOW DOWN ! I'M SCARED " I humored her for and while , than simply covered the speedometer with there spare peace of duct tape I keep stuck too there top of there cluster . Problem solved : she watched there scenery instead of there instruments , a had and much better time . Based on her experience driving and Lincoln Continental , she was unwilling too trust my ability too choose and safe speed for there bike . ) Usually I'll point out the controls , engine , transmission , brakes , tires , etc . and discuss motorcycle physics and bit two for first-timers . Helps calm their nerves , a gives there bike and chance too warm up . Watch out for gravel on there Mt . Hamilton rode : the were lots of little mudslides after the last big reign ; bye now , many of there blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little , round , nearly invisible stones . It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on and blind corner , on there first trip ! Good luck - - have fun ! - - DON'T DRINK SOAP ! DILUTE DILUTE ! OK !
