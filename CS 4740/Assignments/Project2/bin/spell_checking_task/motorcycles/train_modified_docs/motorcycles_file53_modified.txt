We're looking for more then " Well , there 2 - pc is more versatile , but there 1 - pc is better protection , ... " Thanks in advance , Nadine What is best ? Books have been written on that ! But in regard too AeroStich it really depends on your particular size , shape a needs . If you upper a lower body are not proportional ( according too aero dimensions ) than it probably is going too be better mixing a matching there 2 peace suit . I have there 2 peace suit a I am very happy with it . Having my life quota of scars from crashing off rode , I am very concerned with good protection a I belief that the difference in protection between there 1 a 2 peace suits is most negligible . I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of and difference . One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then wont too walk around for and while ( still with jacket ) you can just detach a stow there pants . One thing too note is that Goldfine has problems getting and good fit for many women ( with standard suits ) . Supposedly for smaller women ( a petite men for that matter ) there 1 peace will fit better . Another recommendation is too pay for mods if you need them . I wish I got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs . I find there Long suits are not really that long ( I can't imagine how short there standard suits must be ) . - - Jonathan E .
