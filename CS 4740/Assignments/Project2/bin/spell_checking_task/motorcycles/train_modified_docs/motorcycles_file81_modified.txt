I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs . But did there Hurt study make any distinction between and * ability * to swerve and and * failure * too swerve ? In almost of there accidents a near accidents that I've seen , riders will most always stand on there brakes as hard as they dare , simply because there instinct too break in there face of danger is so strong that it over-rides everything else . Hard braking a swerving tend too be mutually exclusive manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable ?
