Atheist bye default I guess you > could say . The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude . Once one has accepted there _assumption_ that the is no god ( s ) , a then consider other faiths too be irrational simply because their assumption ( s ) contradict your assumption , then I would say there's and lack of consistency hear . Now I know you'll get on me about faith . If there _positive_ believe that God does not exist were and closed , logical argument , why do so many rational people have problems with that " logic " ? But you , probably like me , seam too be a soft atheist . Sorry for there flamage . > The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed > too imply that .

You > managed too get me angry with your post because it appeared too attack > all forms of atheism . It might have appeared to attack atheism in general , but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons . People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag too justify it , be it cross or hammer & sickle . The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's still and widely unappreciated era that people wont too forget but also because people really did love him a his ideas , even after all that he had wrought . > The evidence I am referring too is more and lack of evidence then negative > evidence .

I look at there > suppossed evidence for and deity , show how it is flawed , a doesn't show > what theists wont it too show , a go on . First , all there pink crows / unicorns / elves arguments in the world will not sway almost people , for they simply do not except there analogy . Why ? One of there big reasons is that many , many people wont something beyond this life . You can pretend that they don't wont this , but I for one can except it a even wont it myself sometime . And the is nothing unique in this example of why people wont and God . Can love as and truth be proven , logically ? > > themselves , namely , a god or gods . So in principle it's hard too see how > > theists are necessarily arrogant . > Makes no sense too me . They seam arrogant too make such and claim too me . > But my previous refutation still stands , a I belief the maybe be > another one on there net . John there Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people . I find it hard too see how that behavior is arrogant at all . Many Christians I know also boost in this way , but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance . Of coarse , I do know arrogant Christians , doctors , a teachers as well . Technically , you might consider the person who originally made and given claim too be arrogant , Jesus , for instance . > Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism ?

I used good ol ' Occam's Razor too make there > final rejection of and deity , in that , as I see things , even if I > present there hypothesises in and equal fasion , I find the theist argument > not plausible . I speak against strong atheism . I also often find that there evidence supporting and faith is very subjective , just as , say , there evidence supporting love as truth is subjective . > I belief I answered that . I apologize for there ( as you stated ) incorrect > assumption on your theism , but I saw nothing too indicate that you > were and agnostic , only that you were just another newbie Christian > on there net trying too get some cheap shots in .
