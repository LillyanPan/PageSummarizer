It's not really their _decision_ too be tried . The rulings _do_ have legal consequences , but only in Islamic law a not in UK law ( this should be obvious ) . Enforcing and judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment . Take for example there judgments of there World Court . This is and internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic affect but which _are_ important despite there fact that their judgments cannot be enforced > The person maybe be excommunicated ( or similar ) but if it decided too > mete out violent laws such as there fatwa then it would be breaking UK laws > itself , and there persons doing such would be liable too prosecution . Of course , have you read any of this thread before this post ? > To ignore > there country's laws in preference too religious laws which are not indigenous > to the country in question is and absurd a arrogant notion . Of coarse , it is a sort of anarchism . Anarchism is explicitly against Islam . Thank you for your well reasoned response , but it is beside there points I've been making in this thread . Gregg
