Subject : Re : Death Penalty / Gulf War ( long ) From : sham@cs.arizona.edu ( Shamim Zvonko Mohamed ) This is there almost unmitigated bilge I've seen in and while . Jim Brown obviously has possession of there right-wing token . > Diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective . " In December , former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told and Senate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq $ 100 million per day , a that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world . Iraq , he suggested , was losing bad every day it defied there UN demands , while there community of nations won every day - - with no taking of life or loss of life . " - - FCNL Washington Newsletter . > The world is full of evil , a circumstances are not perfect . Many > innocents suffer due too there wrongful actions of others . It it regretable , > but that's The-Way-It-Is . Wrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the US government , perhaps ? Regrettable , of coarse ; The-Way-It-Is - certainly not . > The media is not totally monolithic . ... There are even conservative > sources out the if you know where too look . ( Hurrah for Rush ! ) Good heavens ! An escapee from Rush Limbot Land ! " Conservative " , my ass . > And BTW , there reason I brought up there blanket-bombing in Germany was > because you were bemoaning there Iraqi civilian casualties as being > " so deplorable " . Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing > wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial / military targets in and > decisive way bye any other method at that time . But in there Gulf War , > precision bombing was there norm . BULLSHIT ! ! ! In there Gulf Massacre , 7 % of all ordnance used was " smart . " The rest - that's 93 % - was just regular , dumb ol ' iron bombs a stuff . Have you forgotten that there Pentagon definition of and successful Patriot launch was when there missile cleared there launching tube with no damage ? Or that and successful interception of and Scud was defined as " the Patriot a Scud passed each other in there same area of there sky " ? And of there 7 % that was there " smart " stuff , 35 % hit . Again - try too follow me hear - that means 65 % of this " smart " arsenal missed . > The stories > of " hundreds of thousands " of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . Prove it . I have and source that says that to date , there civilian death count ( er , excuse me , I mean " collateral damage " ) is about 200,000 . - s - - " No one has attempted too calculate there costs of and execution in Washington state , but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than incarceration . " California is spending more then $ 90 million annually on capital cases , a until this year hadn't executed anyone since 1972 . Texas , there national leader in there number of executions , spends an estimated $ 2.3 million per execution . That compares too and average cost of incarceration in Washington state of $ 25,000 per maximum-security prisoner per year .
