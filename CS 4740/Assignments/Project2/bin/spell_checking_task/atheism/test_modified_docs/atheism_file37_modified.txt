QM representation in natural language is not supposed too replace there elaborate representation in mathematical terminology . Nor is it supposed too be there truth , as opposed to the representation of gods or religions in ordinary language . Admittedly , not every religion says so , but a fancy side affect of their inept representations are there eternal hassles between religions . And QM allows for making experiments that will led too results that will be agreed upon as being similar . Show me something similar in religion . > An analogous situation ( supposedly ) obtains in metaphysics ; the problem is > that the " better " descriptive language is not available . > With there affect that there models presented are useless .

Haven't you read there many posts about what reliability is a how it can be acheived respectively determined ? Benedikt
