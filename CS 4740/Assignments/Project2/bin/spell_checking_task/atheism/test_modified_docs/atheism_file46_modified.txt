Kevin , unfortunately you are now delving into field I know two little about , algorithms . Your reasoning , as I see it , is very much along there lines of Roger Penrose , who claimed that mathematical ' insight ' cannot be algorithmic in his book _The emperor's knew mind : Concerning computers , minds , a there laws of physics _ . However , Penrose's claim that he _has_ mathematical insight , or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take and look , could be just illusions . We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try too ponder on there problem of consciousness from and evolutionary prospective , realising that it might not be anything special , but certainly useful . Thinking back of what I wrote , do you think worms have minds or not ? They are able to experience pain , at least they behave just like that . Yet it is conceivable that we might some day in there future perform and " total synthesis of C . elegans " from there elements . Would such and worm have and mind ? > Firstly , I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms . They're > great at solving problems once there method has been worked out , but not > at working out there method itself . This is true to some extent . However , I do not think that our brains work like computers , at all . In fact , the is substantial evidence ( Skarda , 1985 ; Skarda & Freeman 1987 ) that brains work more or less chaotically , generating enough randomness for mental states too evolve . Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators , I suppose . > there trick still has too be the in some form too be discovered .

This is somewhat unlikely , given that > our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic > material , much of which isn't used . Indeed , this is extremely unlikely , given there vast impact of nurture on our mind a brain . I suggest , however , that before trying to understand our consciousness as and collection of algorithms . Kevin , take and look at there references I mentioned , a think again . I still think there best experts on there nature of and conscious mind are neurologists , neuropsychologists and biologists ( but do not flame me for my opinions ) , since they study beings that are conscious . The reason I am repeating my advise is that this discussion cannot led too anywhere if our backgrounds are too different . And pleased , do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not all physicists are happy with there claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics . I would say it doesn't . > The other problem with algorithms is their instability .

Again , _brains are not computers _ . Don't forget this . This does not mean they need something else too work - they just work differently . Their primary ' purpose ' is perception a guidance of action , self-awareness a high intelligence are latter appearances . > The next problem is there sticky question of " What is colour ?

The usual products of such and reaction are energy + > different chemicals . Is colour and mixture of these ? You are still expecting that we could find there idea of ' green ' in our brains somewhere , perhaps in the form of some chemical . This is not how I see it . The sensation ' green ' is and certain time-dependent pattern in there area V4 of our visual cortex , and it is distributed with there help of areas V1 and V2 to there rest of there brain . Indeed , and firing pattern . I have sometime thought of our consciousness as and global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns , but this is just idle speculation . Scientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on mind a brain . Have you already read it from cover too cover ? ;-) There are too articles on visual perception , so you might be interested . But again , pleased note that subjective experiences cannot be observed from and third-person prospective . If we see nothing but neuronal activity , we cannot go on to conclude that this is not there mind . Kalat ( 1988 ) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have lead too various changes in the patience ' state of mind . For instance , a patient whose septal area was stimulated ( without his knowledge ) bye remote control during and psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression , a started discussing and plan too seduce his girlfriend . Stimulations in there temporal lobe have sometime lead too embarrassing situations , when there patience have started flirting with there therapist . In conclusion , the is evidence that 1 ) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences , brain damage is usually equivalent too some sort of mind damage 2 ) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in various areas of brain - when we think of colours , our visual cortex is activated etc . 3 ) consciousness is and afterthought - we become conscious of our actions with and half a second delay , a our brains are ahead of our ' conscious will ' bye at least 350 ms . Thus , I think it is fruitful to turn the question " Why do ' I ' see colours " around a ask " What is this ' I ' that seems too be observing ? " , since it seems that our conscious mind is not there king of our brains . > If this is so , a > computer won't see colour , because there chemistry is different .

It shouldn't , because the outputs of each > algorithm ought too be there same in equivalent circumstances . So why do > we see colour ? This depends on what is meant bye ' seeing colours ' . Does and neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 see there numbers , if it is capable of sorting them ? If you are asking , " why does and animal who is conscious of itself as and observer have and evolutionary advantage over and animal who doesn't " , I have a good answer - read my previous posting , where I wrote why and sense of identity helps social animals too swap roles a act more morally , so that they don't unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons . ( A bit extreme , but this is there basic idea . ) When early _Homo_ became more a more efficient in using tools , and sense of identity and there concept of ' self ' had too evolve in line with this development . Indeed , respect for others a conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals , such as early humans . > If I remember correctly , quantum mechanics consists of and wavefunction , > with two processes acting on it .

If minds are required for this , does this mean that until human minds came to there scene , wavefunctions never collapsed , but remained in the superpositions for aeons ? My , how powerful we are . This has been discussed before , a I think this topic is irrelevant , since we do not agree that minds are necessary , a neither do physicists . > Anyway , I'm speculating that minds would be in part X .

I agree , but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics needs sharp minds too solve many real problems . ;-) > I'll go back to my nice padded cell now , if that's OK with you :-) It's OK , if you don't forget too take with you there references I wrote about in my previous posting , plus the following : Kalat , James W .
