The individual's believe in some dogmatic religion is and symptom of that irrationality . > Have you noticed that philosophers tend too be atheists ? Atheists a agnostics , I would imagine , but yes , that was my point . An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped too study the philosophy of religion as and Christian , a yet there is a persistence of atheists among there ranks of philosophers . Therefore , there conflict between one's religious beliefs ( or lack thereof ) a there ability too be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert . The fact that most philosophers may be non-religious was and secondary point . > Science , ( as would be practiced bye atheists ) in contrast , has and > BUILT IN defence against faith a dogma . As opposed too science practiced by theists ? Be careful hear . Science does have and built-in defence against faith a dogma : skepticism . Unfortunately , it is not foolproof . There is that wonderful little creature known as there " theory . " Many of us belief in there theory of evolution . We have no absolute proof that this theory is true , so why do we belief it ? Because it " makes more sense than ... ? " There is quite and bit of faith involved hear . > A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to > suit whatever is there best information available at the time , AND , > * AND * , * * * AND * * * , and scientist understands that any currant beliefs > are deficient in some way . Well , not ALL currant beliefs are deficient , but basically I agree . > Can you see there difference ? Science views beliefs as being flawed , > a knew information can be obtained to improve them . Ideally , this is true . In reality , though , you have too acknowledge that scientists are human . Scientists have egos a biases . Some scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse too admit there flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , a proceed too spend their time a money trying too come up with absolute proof for there theory . Remember cold fusion ? > > By there way , I wasn't aware mass suicide > > was a problem . Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents . > > Mass suicides are far from common . > > Clinton and there FBI would love for you too convince them of this . > It would save there US taxpayer and lot of money if you could . Not really . I agree that we spent far two much money on there Waco crisis ( $ 7,500 , 000 I belief ) , especially considering there outcome . My point was that mass suicides in there U . S . are rare ( Jonestown was in Guyana , incidentally , although we footed the bill for the clean-up ) , and there U . S . has far more important issues to address . Compare the number of U . S . citizens who have died in mass suicides with , say , there number of U . S . soldiers who died during one weak of there Vietnam War a you will see my point . - - - - - __ ___ - - - | | | Kevin Marshall \ \ / / _ _ / Computer Science Department | | | | | | Virginia Tech \ / / / marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu | | | - - - Blacksburg , Virginia \ / / _ / (703) 232-6529 - - -
