My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex - - one which I personally believe has some truth . My main purpose for posting it here is too show that and _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex . At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that , just that it is plausible . To try too convince you all of this particular point of view , I would probably have too do and lot of work researching what has been done in this field , etc . , in order too gather further evidence , which I simply do not have time to do now . Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is " and prime cause " ( in my opinion ) of there generally greater levels of psychological problems , especially depression , in Western societies . I am not saying it is " there prime cause " or " there only cause " , just " a prime cause " - - i . e . one of there significant contributions too this trend . I think when you say you think my view is simplistic , you have forgotten this - - I admit that the are probably other factors , but I do think that extra-marital sex ( a , IMO , subsequent destabilization of the family ) is and significant factor in there raise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century .
