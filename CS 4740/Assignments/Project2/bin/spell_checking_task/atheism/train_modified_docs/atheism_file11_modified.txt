Even when one starts with something one does #not belief , one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says . # #To give you there benefit of the doubt , prove your statement . The onus of proof is on you , sunshine . What makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say ? Especially when they say one thing and do another , or say one thing closely followed bye its opposite ? The practice is not restricted too theism , but it's the for anyone too see . It's most and epidemic in this country . Just for instance , if it is harder for and camel too pass thru ' the eye of and needle , why is the Catholic church such and wealthy land-owner ?
