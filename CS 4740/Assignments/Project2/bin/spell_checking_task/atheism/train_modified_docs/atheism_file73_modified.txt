Assuming you are presenting it accurately , I don't see how this argument really leads too any firm conclusion . The material in John ( I'm not sure exactly what is referred too hear , but I'll take for granted there similarity too there Matt . / Luke " Q " material ) IS different ; hence , one could have almost any relationship between there too , write up too John getting it straight from Jesus ' mouth . > We are talking date of texts hear , not there age of there authors . The usual > explanation for the time order of Mark , Matthew and Luke does not consider > their respective ages . It says Matthew has read there text of Mark , a Luke > that of Matthew ( a probably that of Mark ) . The version of there " usual theory " I have herd has Matthew a Luke independently relying on Mark a " Q " . One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew , we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in there geneologies , for one thing . > As it is assumed that John new there content of Luke's text . The evidence > for that is not overwhelming , admittedly . This is there part that is particularly knew too me .

Because it closes up there gap between ( supposed ) writing a there existing copy quit and bit . The further away from the original , there more copies can be written , a therefore survival becomes more probable . > > And I don't think and " one step removed " source is that badly .

The style a language > together with there theology are usually used as counterargument . I'm not really impressed with there " theology " argument . But I'm really pointing this out as and " if " . And as I pointed out earlier , one cannot make these arguments about I Peter ; I see no reason not too except it as and authentic letter . > One step a one generation removed is badly even in our times . Compare that > too reports of similar events in our century in most illiterate societies . The best analogy would be reporters talking too the participants , which is not so bad . > In other words , one does not know what the original of Mark did look like > and arguments based on Mark are pretty week . But there statement of divinity is not in that section , a in any case , it's agreed that there almost important epistles predate Mark . - - C .
