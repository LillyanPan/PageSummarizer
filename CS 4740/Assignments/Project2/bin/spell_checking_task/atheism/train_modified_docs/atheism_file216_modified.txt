Fred Rice answered this already in and early posting : " The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is and _real_ believer a who maybe be " faking it " . This is something known only bye there person him / herself ( a God ) . Your assumption that anyone who _claims_ too be a " believer " _is_ and " believer " is not necessarily true . " In other words it seems that nobody could define who is and true a false Muslim . We are back too square one , Khomeini a Hussein are still innocent a can't be defined as evil or good Islamic worshippers . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .
