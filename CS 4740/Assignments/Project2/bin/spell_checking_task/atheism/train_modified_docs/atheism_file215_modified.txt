A climatologist ( Ithink that was his profession ) named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake would hit there New Madrid fault on Dec . 3 . Some schools in Missouri that were on there fault line actually cancelled school for there day . Many people evacuated New Madrid a other towns in teh are . I wouldn't be suprised if the were more journalists in there area then residents . Of coarse , teh earthquake never occured . HOw do I know about his ? I used too live in Southern Illinois a the lican middle school was built directly on there fault line . No we still had school ... We laughed at there poor idiots who believed there prediction . :) :) :) :) Bob , if you're wanting and excuse too convert too Christianity , you gonna have to look elsewhere . Tammy " No Trim " Healy
