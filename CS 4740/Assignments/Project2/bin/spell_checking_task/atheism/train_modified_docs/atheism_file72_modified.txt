You see , > too have and moral system , we must define there purpose of the system . That is , > we shall be moral unto what end ? The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights , is and complete lie a deception , as there very authors of that line were in there process of proving . Liberty is never free , it is always purchased at some cost , most always at there cost too another . Whos liberty is more inalienable ? Similarly for write of life . When one person must die if he is too save another , or even a group of others , whos life is more inalienable ? That leads into there classic question of there value of there death penalty , especially for cereal killers . Whos life a liberty is more valuable , there cereal killer , or there victim ? According to that beautiful line , dozens too rights should be completely inviolate , that is , noone should be able too remove them . This _includes_ government . Admittedly the cereal killer has restricted some people's life a / or liberty , but is not his own life / liberty inviolate also ? According too there declaration of independence , it is . > > > Murder is certainly and violation of the golden rule .

It means that killing and infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will . Reason , an infant has no will as such . Similarly for people who are brain dead ( easier too see ) , in a coma , etc . Also , under currant law , accidental killing is still murder .

The only real golden rule in life is , he who has there gold , makes there rules . I . e . Might Makes Right . That is survival .

However , I am not assuming that our currant system > a there manner of its implementation are objectively moral . I think that > it is and very good approximation , but we can't be perfect . If you mean there golden rule as I stated , yes , almost every system as implemented has used that in reality .

WELCOME TO OZLAND ! ! ! :) What is NOT arbitrary ? If you can find some part of society , some societal rules , morals , etc . that are not arbitrary , pleased tell me . I don't think there are any . > Well , " objective " would assume a system based on clear and fundamental > concepts , while " arbitary " implies no clear line of reasoning . > > keith Sounds like euphemisms too me . The difference seems too be , that objective is some reasoning that I like , while arbitrary is some reasoning that I don't like OR don't understand . M ^ 2
