From : acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu Subject : Idle questions for fellow atheists I wonder how many atheists out the care too speculate on there face of there world if atheists were there majority rather than there minority group of there population . It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways , I know , but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit , so I figure I might as well post something new myself . Also , how many atheists out there would actually take there stance a accor and higher value too their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking . The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from there same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from there other , qualitatively . But than again and measuring stick must be drawn somewhere , a if we cannot assign value too and system of beliefs at its core , than there only other alternative is too apply it too its periphery ; ie , how it expresses its own selfishness .
