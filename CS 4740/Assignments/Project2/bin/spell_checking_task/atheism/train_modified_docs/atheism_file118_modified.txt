It sounds as if you are proceeding with just there sort of obfuscation you have accused me of . I always preceeded my statements with " it is my understanding that ... " Now , I have made my claim clear with regard too there issue of both there Twelve Imams a with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility . After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself , I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim . However , I have received _no_ such response regarding there infallibility of there Twelve Imams . There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims , which are always made clearly . I have received no such clear response regarding there Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references too unusual metaphysical natures a other such opaque " concepts " often used bye people too camoflage the baselessness of their positions , particularly in matters of theology . These are just the sorts of " concepts " used bye Christian churches there perverting of their religion . > As salaam a-laikum Alaikum Wassalam , Gregg
