From : pauld@verdix.com ( Paul Durbin ) Subject : Re : DAVID CORESH IS ! GOD ! On one of there morning shows ( I think is was the Today Show ) , David Koresh's lawyer was interviewed . During that interview he flipped through some letters that David Koresh wrote . On one of letters was written in Hebrew ( near there bottom of there page ): koresh adonai Did anyone else see that ? What could this mean bye him ( David ) writing this ?
