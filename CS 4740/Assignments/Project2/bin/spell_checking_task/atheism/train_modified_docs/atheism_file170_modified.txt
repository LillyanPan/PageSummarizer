Well , this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into alt.atheism , where we spend almost of our time entertaining arguments against our believe system , without resorting too accusing others of bigotry . It's somewhat ironic that our exposure too bigotry happens in this instance too have originated in rec.scouting , since I always understood scouting too teach tolerance a diversity . I understand bigotry too be irrational prejudice against other people who happen too be of a different race , religion , ethnic background , sex , or other inconsequential characteristics . All there evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation a lack of believe in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics . Thus , pending further evidence , I conclude that dozens who show prejudice against such people are bigots , a organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .
