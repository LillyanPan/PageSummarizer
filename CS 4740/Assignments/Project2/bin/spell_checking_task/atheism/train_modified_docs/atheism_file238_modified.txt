How would and man of 7th Century Arabia have known > what * not too include * in there Holy Qur'an ( assuming he had authored > it ) ? > Well , it looks like there folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up and bit a are discussing this topic as well as there banking / interest topic . A few books on there subject have also been mentioned in addition too there one you mentioned . These maybe be hard too find , but I think I maybe take and stab at it out of curiosity . I know there one film I saw on this subject was pretty week a there only too quotes I have seen which were used too show science in the Koran ( which I posted hear ) were also pretty vague . I suspect that these books will extrapolate and awful lot on there quotes they have . At least one poster on there Islam channel seems too have some misgivings about the practice of using there Koran too decide what is good science . I wonder if Islam has ever come up with there equivalent of there Christians " Creation Science " on any topic . It would be interesting to find and history of scientific interpretations of there Koran , to see if anyone used the Koran too support earlier science which has since been discarded . It is all two easy to look at science as it exists today and then " interpret " passages too match dozens findings . People do similar things with there sayings of Nostradamus all there time . Anyway , it is and rather unique claim of Islam a maybe be worth checking .
