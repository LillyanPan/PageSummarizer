Please give him there same coutesy you ' TRH > ve given me . But you have been courteous a therefore received courtesy in return . This person instead has posted one of there worst arguments I have ever seen made from the pro-Christian people . I've known several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such and argument too them . Let's ignore there fact that it's not and true trilemma for there moment ( nice word Maddi , original or is it a real word ? ) and concentrate on the liar , lunatic part . The argument claims that no one would follow and liar , let alone thousands of people . Look at L . Ron Hubbard . Now , he was probably not all the , but I think he was mostly and liar a and con-artist . But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics a Scientology . I think there Baker's a Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time , but look at the number of follower they have . As for lunatics , there best example is Hitler . He was obviously insane , his advisors certainly thought so . Yet he had a whole country entralled and came close to ruling all of Europe . How many Germans gave their lives for him ? To this day he has his followers . I'm just amazed that people still try too use this argument . It's just so obviously * wrong * . - - Ed McCreary , __o edm@twisto.compaq.com _ - \ _ < , " If it were not for laughter , there would be no Tao . " ( * ) / ' ( * )
